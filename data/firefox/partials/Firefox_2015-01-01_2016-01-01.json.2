The problem I see is that the search code and the autocomplete code are interdependent in ways that don't make sense, hence causing people (like Blake and me) to forget to think about edge cases that they need to care about.

That would include trying the panel and so on, or moving it to a different toolbar and collapsing that toolbar. :-)\n\nI've lamented before that we have a large number of customizability options that often interact in surprising ways that are hard to test adequately (cf. http://www.gijsk.com/blog/2014/04/why-doing-visual-refreshes-of-firefox-is-hard/ ). That's not to say that we should get rid of all of them (although I do think we should push back against even more where possible), just that we need to be extra vigilant.\n\nPerhaps we can write some kind of fuzzing test tool that checks common interactions in fuzzed UI states, or something. Kind of like MattN's screenshot tool, but for functional things. I can file a bug on that.\n\n> > I don't think the effort required to write a test here is commensurate with\n> > the size of the problem and the likelihood that it'll recur.\n> \n> I'm hoping to separate the searchbar panel code from the generic\n> autocomplete code in bug 1119250, so hopefully that will make it less likely\n> to recur.

I will upload a new patch with correct checks and I will move the comment which has gotten displaced from the existing if condition, too.\n\n> By the way, is there a good reason for web page form autocomplete to use a\n> binding implemented in urlbarBindings.xml?

When the window is still to small the handlersView doesn't shrink to fit the window. Also no change with additionally removing the flex: 1 from handlersView.\n\nBut I think it's better with the max-height to not fix the height when it's not needed.",

This can be done in this function for instance: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/highlighter.js#267\n\n- Then an event handler function needs to be assigned to this listener. This function will need to find the right node, starting from the node currently being hovered (either its parent, or child). Here's how hovered nodes get highlighted and sent to the toolbox: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/highlighter.js#224\nSo we'll need to change this function to store the currently hovered node somewhere on the instance. Then when the right key is pressed, use this node to get to the right node.\nWith the right node located, we then need to call the |this._walker.attachElement(node);| part of |_findAndAttachElement| and then emit the \"picker-node-hovered\" event.\n\n- We also need to change the |_onPick| handler (http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/highlighter.js#212) because the click won't go to the right node once we've pressed, say, W to select the parent.\n\nI guess this is enough to get started.

While it may be a good idea to remember the childNode (and this is easily implemented), it can also defeat the purpose of previousSibling and nextSibling. Imagine browsing through your Linux directory. You expect to land on the first child when moving into a parent directory. Isn't that good programmer sense?

Not great, but we can't use N for Next since we already have N for Narrow.\nI'm open to other ideas.\n\n> > As I commented below, we also need to check whether the current node has children, \n> > parentNode, previous or next siblings before trying to select any of them.\n> > If not, we should just early return from the onKey function and\n> > not do anything (currentNode should remain unchanged).\n> Hmm.

But my point is that if you start at a node, then go up to the parent then down again, I'm pretty sure you'd expect the same node to be selected again. Yes this is different from, say, a file system, but this tool is to select elements in the page, not really navigate the DOM tree as a file system. The main point of the tool is to be a visual aid for people to find elements on the page, by looking at the page, not so much at the DOM tree representation in the toolbox. So I'm thinking it makes more sense to remember the previously selected node.\nLet's ask for more feedback from other people.\n\n> One quick question: I am using mercurial queues to make patches.

While it may be a good idea to remember the childNode (and this is easily implemented), it can also defeat the purpose of previousSibling and nextSibling. Imagine browsing through your Linux directory. You expect to land on the first child when moving into a parent directory. Isn't that good programmer sense? Also wouldn't going back to previously selected childNode throw some people off, when they are actually expecting to move linearly through elements? (This is all IMHO. Don't mean to be rude.)",

Here are some pointers:\n\n- Since you already added the _onKeyDown handler, you'll just have to add 2 new cases in it, one for Esc, the other for Enter.\n\n- On Enter: just emit the \"picker-node-picked\" event with the right currentElement, like _onPick does.\n\n- On Esc: you'll have to call cancelPick to stop getting called when mouse/keyboard events happen on the page and, you'll have to let the UI know that the picker has stopped. We currently don't have anything that does this so I believe we need to introduce a new event, maybe called \"picker-canceled\". You should send it like the others are sent:\nevents.emit(this._walker, \"picker-canceled\");\n\nNow, the UI should listen to this event, look in toolbox-highlighter-utils.js: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/framework/toolbox-highlighter-utils.js#131\nThis is where the UI listens to the \"picked\" and \"hovered\" events. So add a new listener to the \"canceled\" event here that executes stopPicker.",

So emitting the \"picker-node-picked\" with currentNode would change the selection even though the user has pressed ESC.

    "text" : "Created attachment 8557223\nbug_1120111: rev_3: Added onPickerCanceled event\n\nSo a patch after a long time.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n1. Esc sequence has its very own emit message \"picker-node-canceled\" and handler |onPickerCanceled| @browser/devtools/framework/toolbox-highlighter-utils.js\n2. Esc sequence works well and no resetting of _currentNode.\n3. Build works excellent.\n\nTHE BAD:\n1. The tiny little blue \"pickerButton\" is giving me a LOT of trouble. After Esc, it JUST WON'T TURN BACK to black! For essentially the same function as |onPickerNodePicked| (where it successfully turns black), |onPickerCanceled| is giving weird behaviour. I even looked through ALL devtools/framework files just in case my custom |onPickerCanceled| or \"picker-node-canceled\" message were creating trouble. But I couldn't find any problems there. Somehow:\n\t1. The toolbox.selection.setNodeFront() is not working all right with my \"reason\" and hence the stopPicker() is not being called.  ~~~~OR~~~~\n\t2. The stopPicker() is doing an early return because \"somehow\" |isPicking| === `false` ~~OR~~\n\t3. Something else, entirely!\n\nTHE UGLY:\n1. I removed the previous/next sibling functionality as you asked, Patrick. And it does not feel good. Since I got used to playing around with the arrow keys (like in \"Markup View Mode\"), no sibling traversal is frustrating. Worse, now every time I have to choose a sibling of the same parent, I have to move my hand from the keyboard to the mouse (often ending up selecting a different parent altogether!). Its kind of a deal breaker. ( :P ) You'll feel it if you do a build with this patch.\n\nSo waiting to here more...",

    "text" : "Comment on attachment 8557223\nbug_1120111: rev_3: Added onPickerCanceled event\n\nReview of attachment 8557223:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for the updated patch. I have made some comments about how to solve the issue you were describing.\nAlso, I have played with the picker, with the patch applied, and I like it a lot. The ESC/ENTER keys help a lot.\nThe left/right keys are very nice too. I don't feel like prev/next sibling is such a big problem not having for now. I like it as it is now and would like to see this land! We can always add them as a second patch or bug later.\nI'll let Brian reply too, but in the meantime, it'd be really great if you could work on adding a new test for this new feature, to avoid future regressions.\nHere's a little help on how to do this:\n\n- Open folder browser/devtools/inspector/test/.\n\n- Create a new test file. A good name could be: browser_inspector_highlighter-keybinding.js\n\n- Register this new test file (by its name) in browser.ini (in the same folder)\n\n- Look at other highlighter test files in the same dir to copy/paste the test structure (license info, use strict, description comment, add_task(...), opening a new tab, etc...\n\n- Then comes the hard part: the actual test code. In your case, you need to start the picker, and then synthesize keyboard events inside the page, to then check whether the picker reacts appropriately. The first thing to do, is to add the ability to synthesize events in the page: you'll need to add a new message listener in doc_frame_script.js. Because the test and the page don't run in the same process, we have to communicate by messages. So in this file, search for \"Test:SynthesizeMouse\", copy/paste the whole message listener block, renaming it SynthesizeKey, and then adapt the code in the callback to use EventUtils.synthesizeKey(theKey, options, node.ownerDocument.defaultView); instead.\nThere are plenty of usage examples for this here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=synthesizeKey&find=&findi=&filter=^[^\\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central\n\n- Once this is done, you can simulate keys from your test file with this:\nyield executeInContent(\"Test:SynthesizeKey\", {...});\n\nI know it's a lot to take in, especially if you have never written mozilla mochitests before, so let me know if you'd like me to create this test file, or help you get started with some code.\n\nOnce the test is written, it can be ran with the following command:\n./mach mochitest-devtools browser/devtools/inspector/test/browser_inspector_highlighter-keybinding.js\n\n::: browser/devtools/framework/toolbox-highlighter-utils.js\n@@ +191,5 @@\n>    }\n>  \n>    /**\n> +   * When the picker is canceled\n> +   * @param  {Object} data Information about the current node selected before canceling\n\nRemove this @param comment.\n\n@@ +194,5 @@\n> +   * When the picker is canceled\n> +   * @param  {Object} data Information about the current node selected before canceling\n> +   */\n> +  function onPickerNodeCanceled(data) {\n> +    toolbox.selection.setNodeFront(data.node, \"picker-node-canceled\");\n\nThis line should be removed.

The use case is the user starts the picker by accident, or realizes they wanted to do something else with the node before picking another one. It's important to make sure that when ESC is pressed, the last selection is still active.\n\n> Thanks for the review, Patrick. I'll write about my next steps in another\n> comment.\nThank you!",

But in your case, you want to make sure the keybindings work while the picker mode is on. And your key event listener isn't added unless the picker mode is on anyway, so you do need to start it.\n> What I was\n> wondering though: After I start the picker, will the rest of my test code\n> still perform as expected?\nYeah it should, although I haven't had a very thorough look at the code yet, you'll have to try and run the test.

We haven't had that need up until now, so I'm not sure you really need it either. What's wrong with waiting for |toolbox.once(\"picker-node-picked\")| as you described above? That looks fine to me.\n\n> 2.

There are just some details that make the test fail, but these things are kind of hard to know if you've not worked with our tests before.\nInstead of just giving you my comments below, I'm also going to attach a patch for you, so you more easily see what I mean.\n\nOne other thing worth fixing (which you'll see in my patch but that I didn't mention below):\nOur tests now run in e10s (multi-process) mode, this means that the test itself runs in a different process than the test page. So accessing DOM elements from the test page is possible via what we call CPOW (cross-process object wrappers), but not recommended and we're trying to move away from using them.\nIn practice, what this means for you is that you should try not to use getNode anymore. This function reaches into the test page, through the process boundary, and returns not the DOM node itself, but a wrapper for it that acts like the DOM node.\n\nSo, you'll see in my patch that I've made a simple change to SynthesizeMouse so it also accepts selectors instead of only CPOWs, this way, we can ask it to simulate mouse-over events on elements without having to get the elements.\nAnd I've also removed occurrences of getNode in the test.\n\n::: browser/devtools/inspector/test/browser_inspector_highlighter-keybinding.js\n@@ +8,5 @@\n> +\n> +const TEST_URL = TEST_URL_ROOT + \"doc_inspector_highlighter_dom.html\";\n> +\n> +add_task(function*() {\n> +\tlet {inspector, toolbox} = yield openInspectorForURL(TEST_URL);\n\nnit: there are mixed tabs and spaces in this file.

But hopefully the code changes are small and obvious enough to not have to know about the animations actors to review this.\n\nThe idea is that the AnimationPlayerActor exposes a |ready| method which is really just a wrapper around the underlying AnimationPlayer ready promise and is very useful to call when an animation starts, to make sure it's not in its pending state anymore.",

We can add that separately later on if we wish.\n\nI was hoping to address two use cases:\n\n1. node-firefox wants an easy way to get Firefox listening on a port[1]\n2. A user tweeted[2] about this and clarified over email that they would like a CLI option for this\n\nAn important note is that this doesn't help if Firefox is already running, at least not on Mac where remoting doesn't really work, so we'd need something else still for that case.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox/issues/4\n[2]: https://twitter.com/icoderforfun/status/552733995818319872",

Click search-go-button I also tried other buttons that I think have tracking i.e. back-button / forward-button\n3. Wait a few hours and check back. Nothing\n\nBtw I am on master when I did the above steps. Furthermore, I should mention that I have done this to build:\n\n1. In my repo I have directly modified https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/modules/BrowserUITelemetry.jsm\n2. I did ./mach build\n\nAm I doing something wrong?",

Specifically, its \"restoreDefaultEngines\" method:\n\nhttps://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/eab4a81e4457/browser/components/search/content/engineManager.js#l340\n\nLooking into this a bit further, though, and it looks like I may have been wrong in marking this as a \"good first bug\", because changing that function to reset the default engine is actually a little bit involved.\n\nGiven that you're looking for a first bug, perhaps you'd be interested in taking another bug instead? Perhaps bug 510516?\n\nOtherwise, I can walk you through the changes needed here, but multiple files would need changing and we may need a few cycles of feedback before getting a final patch - up to you!",

Would I be passing it just the plain old name/string of the default mozilla search engine (is that Yahoo or Google?), or is there another value I should be giving this function?",

This was because in the buildDefaultEngineDropDown function, the dropdown menu defaulted to show what was previously selected and only show the current default if no search engine was selected in the menu. I believe that this is pointless as the current default engine is always updated whenever a new engine is selected in the dropdown menu, so there is never a case where you would want to use the selected engine over the actual current default engine. Even if in theory there was a case where the selected engine should be picked over the currentEngine and the selected engine is not equal to the currentEngine, this would not be good since the selected engine in the dropdown menu would not properly reflect the actual search engine that is being used, so this should never be the case. I therefore removed the portion in buildDefaultEngineDropDown() where it first attempts to set the current engine to the one that is selected in the dropdown menu. This fixes my problem and shouldn't change any of the previous functionality in any way.",

Now that all changes apply immediately, it's indeed pointless and we can remove it.\n\n># HG changeset patch\n># User Jeremy Francispillai <jeremyjpf@gmail.com>\n># Parent  e2a910c048dc82fc3be53475f18e7f81f03e377b\n>Changed \"Restore default engines\" button action to also reset the selected engine to the default engine.\n\nIn the future, could you please make the commit message follow this format?\nBug NNNNNNN - <message>, r=<reviewer>",

Our goal is to build an experience that allows us to do this in a holistic and systematic way. Instead of having a new user onboarding tour as a distinct piece in a series of distinct pieces, we want to create one continuous onboarding experience that tells a story from download to browsing.\n\nIn addition, weâ€™ll tailor experiences for other use cases:\n* Current user paveover or automatic update\n* Part-time user paveover or automatic update\n\nFor new users, we want to create a setup experience instead of a tour. The distinction being that in a setup, the user can skip steps but sees them all and in a tour, the use can completely dismiss it at any time. \n\nFor updating users, we can continue to use a tour for major updates. For part-time users (those who use another browser as their default) we can use a hybrid setup/tour.\n\nThe attached flowchart outlines how this would work. I'll file a followup bug to create a specification and wireframes for each flow.",

I think that is sensible; the typical reason not to have color-only information is because if they represent warnings or states, they are not accessible to people with various types of alternative-color-vision (\"colorblindness\"). However, in this case, the colors represent only themselves (that is, the colors used as foreground/background/link colors) not some other semantic bit of information, so I don't think this is an issue per sec508/wcag.\n\nWith that, I think the deps now cover all the issues that were identified, so I'm closing this.

Do you already have a build environment set up (i.e. have you completed step 1 from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction)?\n\nOnce you have that, the change required here is described in comment 3. The relevant code in urlbarBindings.xml makes a call to Services.search.addEngine, whose API is defined here:\n\nhttps://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/a6bbabebed2f/netwerk/base/nsIBrowserSearchService.idl#l284\n\nThe last parameter there (\"callback\") is a nsISearchInstallCallback object, which is defined here:\n\nhttps://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/a6bbabebed2f/netwerk/base/nsIBrowserSearchService.idl#l219\n\nIn the urlbarBindings.xml code mentioned in comment 3, the implementation of nsISearchInstallCallback that is passed to Services.search.addEngine() is missing an \"onError\" function, which causes the error in comment 0. To remedy that, you just need to add an empty \"onError\" function (next to the existing \"onSuccess\") function. It doesn't need to do anything, since we don't care to handle the error case here.",

You have <autocomplete object> -> ...some number of objects I don't know... -> SuggestAutoComplete.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null for the entire chain.  Only SAC.prototype had the property before, so delete did nothing, and assignment did nothing because the getter-only property made it a no-op.  With this patch you're defining onto SAC, which is not actually a member of the prototype chain, so the original getter will run every time.\n\nOne possibly more pleasant way to do this might be to move _suggestionLabel onto SuggestAutoComplete itself, entirely.\n\nObject.defineProperty(SuggestAutoComplete, \"_suggestionLabel\",\n{\n  get() {\n    delete this._suggestionLabel;\n    let bundle = Services.strings.createBundle(\"chrome://global/locale/search/search.properties\");\n    return this._suggestionLabel = bundle.GetStringFromName(\"suggestion_label\");\n  }\n});\n\nand then change every |this._suggestionLabel| reference into a |SuggestAutoComplete._suggestionLabel| reference.  That's obviously more change than just modifying this one getter to do what it was intended to do, of course.",

I tried various cases several times, and when \"Choose what to sync\" was checked, I usually did not get the customize.xul modal dialog after migration completed.  \"Usually\" -- the first time I tried with \"Choose what to sync\" checked, I did get the dialog as expected.  Every other time, I didn't.  So there may be some race condition.\n\nFirst, what does work right:  The \"Choose what to sync\" checkbox on the signup page is checked correctly depending on whether I had previously unselected any engines, the data of the \"login\" command received by aboutaccounts.js correctly contains a customizeSync bool, onLogin in aboutaccounts.js correctly sets the showCustomizationDialog pref, and needsCustomization() in browserid_identity.js correctly checks the pref.\n\nThe problem is that once I click the verification email and Firefox sees that I've been verified, a whole bunch of services.sync.* prefs get set, or cleared maybe.  At the same time, browserid_identity.js is going through the initializeWithCurrentIdentity flow.  In every case after I started instrumenting the flow, services.sync.ui.showCustomizationDialog was cleared before browserid_identity.js examined it.  I'm guessing that the one time where I got the customize.xul dialog as expected, it just so happened that showCustomizationDialog was cleared after browserid_identity.js examined it.  Or maybe the whole bunch of prefs wasn't set/cleared that time, maybe because I used an old profile and/or and old Sync account.  That was before I started instrumenting things and used new profiles and Sync accounts.\n\nI'm guessing the whole bunch of prefs being set/cleared is due to the prefs engine kicking in?  I'll investigate more and file follow-up bugs as necessary.",

The bunch of prefs being set/cleared are things like services.sync.clients.lastRecordUpload, things that look like appropriate metadata.  Not just a wholesale set/clearing of the sync.* branch.  And I actually unchecked the prefs engine anyway.\n\nshowCustomizationDialog is cleared by Weave.Service.startOver: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/services/sync/modules/service.js#909\n\nWhich is called by the migrator in _promiseCurrentUserState: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/services/sync/modules/FxaMigrator.jsm#238\n\nSo that's the race?",

Have we worked those kinks out?\n\nYeah, we 'fixed' that problem (i.e. hacked our way around it), so source maps *should* work now. However, we apparently introduced several uses of the Services object in TabSources, and that breaks source handling in workers completely (I've opened bug 1247192). Reminder to self that once that bug is fixed, we should write a test for this, to make sure that source maps do indeed work with worker debugging.\n\nAlso note that source maps are currently not supported in the console, neither on the main thread nor in workers, so that's a separate issue.",

The plugin is just replaced with a gray rectangle (and some sort of \"your plugin died\" text) and everything else works fine. In my experience the malefactor is usually a Flash ad, so the page is actually improved.\n\nOne thing I think we need to make clear is that the \"Kill process\" option will affect multiple tabs (possibly all of them). So \"Kill page\" is not ideal in that sense.",

But \"Stop script or plugin\" is clunky (and why doesn't the browser know which it is?) and still not a verb.\n\nWe don't know what the script/plugin is doing - it could be almost anything (it could be loading data, it could be processing user input, it could be processing stuff it got from the internet or other people, it could just be stuck in a loop to try to DoS the user, ...).

Ryan, should we be able to use the Browser Toolbox Inspector to inspect page contents in e10s mode, or is that something that would have to be enabled in the Browser Content Toolbox?",

We will need to pass in the pref to the WalkerActor when the toolbox is opened, so changing the pref would require a toolbox restart.  In the case of non-e10s BT the pref can be set on by default so it would work just like the currently attached patch does.",

Reason is that with browser.search.showOneOffButtons set to false, you can change the standard search engine with just one click. \n\nIn the new UI with the buttons, the search engine is only changed temporarily for the current tab, and the new search engine is immediately called with the current search text (if there is any). In order to change the standard search engine for all tabs, you will have to go to search engine settings, open the configuration page, and change the standard search engine there.\nThis, in my opinion, adds unnecessary complexity to an otherwise easy configuration (which was one of the reasons I use Firefox). \n\nFurthermore, I often use the search feature in the right-click context menu (selecting a word and search for it using the standard search engine). This comes in handy if, for example, you want to translate a single word into another language. Just select the word and search for it in the dictionary search engine. The results will then open in a new tab. That is very convenient. \n\nNow, with the new UI, I will have to change the standard search engine in settings first.\n\nWhich means that I have to go away from the page I was reading to the search engine configuration page, re-configure the standard search engine, then I'll have to go back to the page I was reading, search for my word, examine the results, then I will have to go to the search engine configuration page again to change my standard back to the previous search engine. \n\nWith the old UI, I only have to switch to the dictionary while being able to stay on the page I wanted to read, do my search, read the results and then switch back to my previous standard with only one click. \n\nTo make a long story short: That new UI is nice but it adds more complexity to the program in the way it is currently implemented. \n\nMy suggestion for the new search UI would be: \n1. If you change the search engine for the current tab, it should also be changed for its right-click context menu. \n2. After the change, the new search engine should not be opened in the current tab (if at all) but only in a new one.\n\nThank you for reading that much text and kind regards,\nGerd",

There are lots of UI people in the development team while almost nobody is available for dealing with the browser's internals (example: e10s, memory consumption). Therefore, the UI is again and again subject to changes where not all of them make sense while a lot of bugs pertaining to the browser engine remain unfixed (example: printing selected parts of a web page).\n\nBut there are some UI changes which would make sense (at least in my opinion) but it seems that they are not that popular. Example: about:plugins and the plugins page under about:addons. I never understood why there have to be two pages / two screens for the same thing, each of them showing different information. \n\nTo make a long story short: I got used to the \"old\" search bar and do not really see the need for replacing it by something that is more cumbersome in its usage.",

This is a clear and blatant step backward in terms of usability.\n\nContinued availability of the older, more user-friendly, searchbar UI was never a \"bug\" in the first place, it is its removal (with the latest version of FF) that is the \"bug\" -- as it needlessly degrades user choice and user experience.\n\n(Parenthetically, I would like to echo the \"off-topic\" response seconding questioning the need for a new search bar in the first place.)",

    "text" : "Removing the old drop down search method totally has created a bug/feature deficiency and should be reversed. It's really really bad and breaks some important user workflows. Fixing a single default search engine (or making it cumbersome to switch) doesn't help with searching by theme - particular in cases where search suggestions is an important prompt - particularly where searches carry specific contexts.\n\nFor instance, if planning a trip to Pals (in Spain). With Google default searching for Pals or Pals Spain gives lots of junk as the word in English is too generic. Switch the default search engine to Wikipedia and most junk disappears and you start to get searches related to Pals the place with related suggestions. Switch default to Google Maps and suggestions focuses on location - so can be used to look for local features (eg Pals Restaurant) without being contaminated. For instance a generic search for \"Costa Brava\" on English speaking sites leads to holiday suggestions, while on Google.es it would lead to local businesses.\n\nFor academic work I switch from a generic Google to Google Scholar to act as a filter on the suggested options. Search for 'ethnographic research' in standard Google you get companies. In Scholar you'd work through academic papers - and usually you want to have about 30-40 links open so setting default is hugely important. \n\nAlternatively for research into country-specific features or characteristics I can say do a set of searches with Google.com as default for US specific, then switch to Google.co.uk for UK specific details. Or for those of us with cross-border lives, switch between the various flavours of amazon.\n\nIt's incredibly useful to be able to switch default search engine at will to change the theme and target of the search for the search session, and with that to see related suggested search text. A one-time default with a cumbersome (or undocumented) switcher method for changing the default diminishes Firefox intensely.",

When FF37 released and the new search interface landed, I was upset but I found showOneOffButtons and it satisfied me, so I went no further.

Not typing the query.  There does not seem to be a way to select the search engine after selecting the text, the only search choice presented is the currently selected one.

All that we-the-users can see is a developer who appears to have (i) no liking for the old UI, (ii) little understanding of how users used the old UI and (iii) little sympathy for users who preferred the old UI, playing a fairly ubiquitous role in determining its replacement.

It does not appear to be even remotely \"apt\" for an \"upset user\" to voice their specific complaints over changes to specific functionality.\n\nThe closest-to-apt forum would appear to be Mozillazine's 'Firefox Features' forum (which incidentally has a popular thread titled \"The new Search engine functions are AWFUL!\", whose second entry is a browser.search.showOneOffButtons how-to). This forum however appears to suffer from the inverse problem to firefox-dev, in that it appears to be all users, no developers. There appear to be no forums where users and developers interact. Does anybody see that this might be the causal \"bug\", of which this latest ruckus is merely a symptom?",

Personally, I suspect moving away from the attributes and towards using CSS for these is a good idea, but we should get feedback about it and then implement it more widely. :-)\n\n::: browser/themes/shared/incontentprefs/search.css\n@@ +2,5 @@\n>   * License, v. 2.0.

Does it make sense to stop cross process forwarding if propagation is stopped (I think it does?).",
