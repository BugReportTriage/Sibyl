Firefox frontend code can't \"intercept\" the icons add-ons add and modify their attributes, because they just use XUL overlays or manually append stuff - we do not get told when this happens. I'm also not sure how many of these icons have tooltips - our own icons (at least the ones next to the identity box) often don't. If you mean the type of icons at the end of the bar, like stop/go/reload, then I guess those do often have tooltips and so the a11y code could do that. I can file a followup for this.",

Yeah a follow-up bug might be nice, although with all this being in flux anyway, we might want to wait on fixing it until we have a new proper mechanism in place that no longer relies on XUL overlays. :)\n\nChanging to f+ given your reply.",

For breakpoints in non-sourcemapped sources, we can simply set breakpoints on all offsets that are entry points for the given line. For sourcemapped sources, the beginning of the given line is always at column 0 in the original source, but may be at any column in the generated source. In a minified script, for example, setting a breakpoint on line 20 in an original source could map to line 1, column 240 in the generated source.\n\nEven if we find the corresponding line in the generated source, we cannot simply set breakpoints on all offsets that map that are entry points for the given line, like we could with non-sourcemapped sources, since multiple original lines can be mapped to a single generated line. This is why we introduced the notion of column breakpoints, so we can set breakpoints on offsets that are entry points for a specific column. For that to work, however, we need to know exactly what columns an original line spans in the generated source.\n\nFinally, there is nothing in the source map spec that guarantees that a single original line maps to a contiguous column spans in a given generated line. It's perfectly possible to map the first half of the original line to one column span generated line, and the second half to another, in such a way that those column spans are not contiguous. Admittedly, this is a very unlikely scenario, and I doubt any source maps actually do this, but since the spec allows for it, we should at least support it.",

The lazy getter would need to return the value from within the object instance. I think that would defeat the purpose of the lazy getter. The worst part is that the Map.protoype.set() is pre-defined and I cannot override it to pass function(key, function(args..){Object manipulation}) like what Dict.setAsLazyGetter() does with Dict.set(). \n\nBTW is there a way to test these files? The source builds just fine after the changes. And since the test_dict.js is no longer run, I see no other way to test. I am especially worried about /toolkit/modules/PropertyListUtils.jsm and the lazy getter function.",

From what I understood about Lazy initialisation, we usually initialise an object or its attribute, the first time the object/attribute is actually used (just-in-time). And I believe |readBound|, may actually be a thunk of code. So the first time the |key| is mapped, its value is initialized to the thunk. The else call is to ensure that any subsequent calls to retrieve |key| result in its mapped value being initialized to the return value of running the thunk.

Get it? Correct me if I screwed up.\n\nThe lazy initializer has performance reasons, while it's true we don't want it to be called more than once, it's also true that we want this object to work simply like an extented Map. A Map allows to just set a value over an existing key, the same should be true for lazy initializers, if I want to replace a lazy initializer I should be able to just by invoking setAsLazyGetter.\nIn this case, based on the code, there's no reason to complicate the API call to ensure 100% we won't call the inizializer more than once, cause the calling code already ensures that, and even if that happens, nothing breaks. So better having a simpler API call, imo.",

At the end of the output there should be a clear message saying if your test passed or not, so if you got confused by the log it's likely that there was a syntax error or something like that that broke things. If you have any trouble running it, let us know and we can help further. But it is very important for anyone writing patches to be able to test their changes and verify that they work.\n\n\n> > @@ +270,5 @@\n> > > +   *         Key to be set, retrieved or deleted.

Everything that is in the top-level scope will run when the file is loaded and make the functions, prototypes and objects defined at the same time. The only ordering that matters is this example:\n\n    line 1:  Car.prototype = {\n    line 2:    accelerate: function() { ... }\n    line 3:  }\n    line 4:  \n    line 5:  function Car() { ... }\n\nThis doesn't work because Car is not a known name at line 1, so you can modify its properties (in this case, \"prototype\"). You need to have declared the function first.\n\n\n> > \n> > The proxy is being used twice, but _lazyHandler is a single object that is\n> > reused.

To do this, I need to be able to move groups around, and with this change, I can't renumber the separators.",

But it might be worth the time/cost to avoid weeks of work, if weeks of work is ever needed.\n\nAs a moderately disinterested observer, it's not clear to me why tags should have limited length.  But I won't going to go out of my way to argue it.  And the relatively unusual (I hope we would generally agree) outlier use case presented in comment 7 is a bit too niche a reason to change that, as far as I'm concerned.\n\n</resume-silence>",

No problem there.\n\nThis bug is that the *tag list* in the Bookmarks Organizer is being truncated.\n\nThat is a very different thing - the impact being that users are now restricted to the number of tags per URL... which is a very different constraint than tag length and doesn't seem to be tied to the problem laid out in bug 407821.\n\nMarco, why are we restricting the length of the sum total of tags per bookmark to 1000 chars?\n\nPerry, for now you could crack open your Firefox and revert the first change in the patch to bug 407821:\n\nhttps://bug407821.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8490732",

There's nothing in that bug that talks about a UI slowdown for many tags under 100 chars but which sum to greater than 1000 chars total. We should have someone test that it does or does not have the same effect that they're seeing with giant single tags.\n\n2. I don't really see anything in that bug which narrows down the amount of text at which the UI actually gets too slow. We have guidelines for what \"too slow\" is, such as research done by our UX team (eg page 10 of https://mozilla.app.box.com/s/aww17rx74k7fjds5vada ). But in that bug, they just picked an arbitrary number :P\n\n3. The patch also didn't make the tagging APIs in Places respect this new sum-of-1000-chars-for-all-tags-per-bookmark constraint. It can easily be broken by adding two tags via the API which sum to greater than 1000 chars.",

It's simpler to always teardown when the selected tab changes (except for the tab detaching case which we may also be able to remove since Tomasz couldn't reproduce the original problem without the code below and I notice that the code is probably broken since the onPageEvent call is missing an argument.

This is a trade-off of how much time to investigate vs the benefits of the code landing.  \n\nIf these were 1/2 the regression (i.e. ~2.5-3%), I would say leave it alone and document why we think the regression happened.  Since this is higher, I would be inclined to do some basic investigation (i.e. not days, but a couple hours at the most).

This was amazingly hard to track down, and I ended up setting by switching to textContent for the label and then using the vw unit in CSS for max-width.\n\nVictor and/or Jordan, please apply the patch and double check that this fixes the issue you are seeing.",

Is this intended? For the \"engine-removed\" case, if the user clicked the 'remove' button from the search preferences, buildDefaultEngineDropDown will have already been called from the removeEngine method. If the engine was removed from somewhere else (eg. by an add-on, or by the search preferences opened in another window), calling buildDefaultEngineDropDown isn't enough because the engine hasn't been removed from gEngineView._engineStore.\n\nThere are 2 possible ways forward here:\n- either you want to go for the smallest patch that fixes this bug as described in comment 0, in which case the patch should be adapted so that buildDefaultEngineDropDown is called only for the engine-current notification.\n- or you want to further cleanup/fix the search.js code, and separate the code actually performing changes from the code displaying changes. Currently the two are entangled, but the code would be significantly simpler if changes were only displayed when receiving notifications. If you want to work on this, the search way to test is to open 'about:preferences#search' in 2 different windows, make changes to the preferences in one window and check that both windows keep displaying the same thing at all times.",

I also changed the code responsible for the removal of an engine so that removing the actual engine is separated from displaying the changes. The code for making the change and displaying the change is also separated for changing the current default engine as well as for adding a new engine. I didn't separate the two operations for the cases where engines are moved around (change engine order by drag and drop, or reordering engines when \"restore default engines\" is clicked) because I cannot think of a good way to update the display once an engine has been  moved. One possible idea that I had for this was to call the Services.search.getVisibleEngines() function and then compare the position of the moved engine in the returned list compared to the displayed list. I didn't implement this because I do not think that it is very efficient and I don't know if there is a better way. Let me know if there is a good way to do this as well as if my current changes make sense. I have attached a diff of my changes so far.",

The only idea I have right now is to move most of the code of the restoreDefaultEngines method to nsSearchService, so that search.js can listen to a single notification for the whole thing, and rebuild the tree and the drop down.

After some profiling it seems there are still issues in _flushMessageQueue (while trying to keep the output scrolled to the bottom as new messages come in), among other places.  I did some work in bug 1045715 to improve this, but it still needs some work.\n\nBut I wouldn't expect 10 or 20 second timeouts due to this (although maybe if you are running a debug build).",

It avoids the UI to \"jump\". Also, in the future, the web animations API will allow us to re-run an ended animation, so we'll need to keep the widget around for this anyway.\n\n- When you pause an animation, then switch to another node and then back to the same one again, the state of the timeline widget is incorrect.\n\n- When an animation ends, the time label continues to be updated until the next synchronization from the actor, that means that for instance, even if the animation has a duration of 1 second, the current time label may show 1.02s for instance.\n\n- Animations that don't repeat (iterationCount=1) shouldn't need to display \"repeats:1\" in the UI.\n\nEach of these 4 things are very minor fixes, a few lines at most, and they're all about polishing the UI, so I didn't file separate bugs for each of them.\n\nI will create separate patches though.",

If there is an animation displayed in the tool and the animation ends, then yes, it does remain visible in the tool, but that's on purpose.

The time label updates using a requestAnimationFrame loop on the client-side. At each iteration of the loop, we detect whether the animations are done or not. If they are, we stop the scrubber and time label, but this could be a few millis after the actual end. We should make sure we position the scrubber and time label exactly at the right end time.\nFiled bug 1219611.\n\n> [4] > - Animations that don't repeat (iterationCount=1) shouldn't need to\n> display\n>     > \"repeats:1\" in the UI.\nSo, this information is displayed in a tooltip when you hover over an animation in the panel.

The other issue related to teardown was fixed (see comment 2).\n\nAnother possible problem may be related to the Hello panel being already opened when the user lands on a tour page. I think in that case the somewhat known issue is that the panel won't be sticky and there isn't much we can do about that unless we are okay with a flicker from re-opening it as sticky (XUL popup limitation due to OS integration). I could see this happening if e.g. an about:home snippet opens the panel and the tour somehow loads in that about:home tab (see bug 1123010) e.g. if the snippet links directly to the tour from the snippet text (which I don't think we're planning on doing anymore).\n\nI guess some of this is more important to test once we actually have snippets and completed tours to test with but some testing can be done in advance with the 35 tour and test pages.",

I don't think usage of this API is that high and I suspect some consumers currently have incorrect data because they don't realize the shortcomings of the API as it is.

The profile dialog writes this here:\n\nhttps://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/profile/content/profileSelection.js#105\n\nBut it doesn't seem like it ever gets set to something else if you start with --profile or -P .\n\n\nReading consumers seem to basically be:\n\nhttps://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/3461f3cae78495f100a0f7d3d2e0b89292d3ec02/browser/components/nsBrowserGlue.js#1292-1299\n\nand about:profiles and the profile manager dialog. I don't know that esp. the latter two will be happy about us changing the meaning. The nsBrowserGlue code looks like it'll throw if the profile is null. Not sure if I missed any other consumers. :-\\\n\nReally, in general, it feels like we could fix this but all the changes in this patch are still going to be necessary to fix the issues raised here and bug 1267575 / bug 883627 .\n\nCan we move the \"make selectedProfile 'sane'\" project to a separate bug? :-)",

I could push that into SetCurrentProfileAsDefault but then it'd only work if we were setting the new profile as the default so we'd only fix it some of the time, which also seems stupid. The alternative, which is to rewrite SetCurrentProfileAsDefault to just return the current profile and push the responsibility for setting it as default or changing its name into the consumer is what the patch already does.\n\nIOW \"just\" fixing bug 883627 already requires either picking this option or changing the selectedProfile semantics, or only fixing it for cases where the profile is the default.",
