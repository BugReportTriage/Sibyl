If you want it to switch urls or switch images or switch titles -- those all require sending additional data to Firefox as well as making server changes to store those extra values and getting those values from the client in the first place. I.e., the client might need to provide 2 titles, 2 urls, 4 images.\n\nIf creative is the biggest issue, a simple fix is to just not use the server provided image and default to the usual thumbnail that history tiles have. However, the pinned tile would still be going to the original url.\n\nThere's a lot of questions, so I would propose moving this out of 39.",

Here's exact sequence of events:\n\n1.  Suggested tile is pinned and turned into a history tile\n2.  Suggested tile still retains partner landing page url and partner background image\n3.  When rendering a tile FX checks if endTime is passed, if so it resets landing url and removes background image.\n4.  After campaign runs out, rendering logic will display the tile as if it came from history\n5   However! FX will display preloaded new tab page once before it replaces preloaded page with newly rendered one.  \n\nSo, a user may see incorrect image and observe wrong landing url only once after the campaign is over.  We may partially help that by setting timeouts for the end of campaign, but this will not work if a user restarts FX before campaign ends.  Having persistent timeouts just to fix that hypothetical error case seems unjustified.  \n\nI would like Mardak/Kevin verify that it's OK to skip timeout implementation.",

And if you change the window's height, you can sometimes see the vertical scrollbar appear and the What's new is pushed off-screen.\n\nTo fix the first problem, I tried using an inline element -- a span instead of a div -- and that worked OK:\n\n    <div id=\"what-wrapper\">\n      <span id=\"newtab-intro-what\">&newtab.customize.what;</span>\n    </div>\n\n#newtab-intro-what {\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n#what-wrapper {\n   position: relative;\n   text-align: center;\n   margin: 25px;\n}\n\nFor the second problem, you need to change the availSpace calculation in grid.js to this or something like it:\n\n    let whatWrapper = document.querySelector(\"#what-wrapper\");\n    let availSpace = document.documentElement.clientHeight -\n                     this._cellMargin -\n                     document.querySelector(\"#newtab-search-container\").offsetHeight -\n                     whatWrapper.offsetHeight -\n                     parseFloat(getComputedStyle(whatWrapper).marginTop) -\n                     parseFloat(getComputedStyle(whatWrapper).marginBottom);\n\nWhatever you use, please make sure that the scrollbar doesn't appear when you resize the window.\n\nAnd a couple of nits: Could you please rename what-wrapper to newtab-intro-what-container to be more consistent with the page's naming scheme?  (Personally I don't think the newtab- prefix is necessary, but it's there, so let's be consistent.)",

A TLS scan would connect via TLS to the server IP on TCP port 443 with the TLS SNI extension for the domain name, but end the connection after a completed TLS connection handshake (either successful or failed). HTTP and up would not be involved; no request for anything. It'd just be TLS connections, but no HTTP connections over those.

(e.g. a full scan might check for Camellia or GOST, but we don't care)\n\nJust to reiterate, I'm just stating that this is all very possible. We may or may not actually want to do this. As we are phasing out things now, and will be doing so more in the future (TLS 1.0, 1.1, and CBC ciphers will eventually need killing as well), it would be something that could be continually helpful if implemented, but it could be considered overkill. We've been willing to build more advanced developer tools directly into Firefox recently, however, so this feature does not seem unreasonable to consider.",

I agree in spirit with degrading the security UI if RC4 is used anywhere, but I want to raise a flag because it will be next to impossible for the user (or the web site owner, trying to hit their site with Firefox) to determine why their UI was degraded.\n\nI understand the challenges involved in trying to warn users through the security UI. The UI can change based on cert chain problems, certificate problems (SHA-1), mixed content, etc. If nothing else, there needs to be a way for a savvy user (or their CA's Tech Support team) to tell why they're seeing gray or yellow or a lock with a line through it, even if that's via the Web Console.",

    "text" : "I'm not sure if I should be replying to this bug or to bug 1158169 (since there is a good deal of overlap in them), but I have a handful of issues with the first draft of the error screen, such as:\n\n- Untrusted (a problem with authentication or integrity) is not a problem with RC4, since that is part of ECDSA/RSA key exchange and/or the HMAC.  RC4 has problems with confidentiality (ie, being Insecure), which is not the same thing.  We can still know we're talking to rc4.badssl.com, even if somebody is decrypting the conversation.\n\n- It has technical jargon (namely RC4) in the main error message.\n\n- The use of \"hackers\" in an error message seems mildly hyperbolic and also possibly misleading, unless you consider a government agency to be a \"hacker\"\n\n- If this page even appears, presumably it is because we have elected to send RC4 amongst the client's supported cipher suites, which means that we are offering to allow them to elect to continue onward, which isn't really currently reflected.  And if that's so, we need to make sure that we don't just say \"Do not submit any sensitive information\", because it's badly misleading: their (highly sensitive) session identifier is likely contained in said request, something that a user is likely to not understand.\n\n--\n\nHere is my suggested wording:\n\nThis Connection is Insecure\n\nThis website's server uses an obsolete encryption technology that makes information you submit, such as passwords and credit card numbers, accessible to eavesdroppers.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nPlease contact the website owners to let them know their site is not secure. It is not recommended to continue should this site contain or receive any sensitive information.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nrc4.badssl.com has chosen to use a cipher (RC4) that is known to have cryptographic weaknesses, and its continued use is prohibited.\n\nI Understand the Risks\n\nIf you understand the risks, you can tell Firefox to continue onward to this site. *Even if you trust the website, this error means that someone may be able to impersonate you or steal your information.*\n\nAdd Exception // Get me out of here!\n\n--\n\nContinuing to send RC4 amongst our supported ciphers is problematic on its own, and may cause these errors to appear when they didn't need to, e.g. when a server selects RC4 even though they may actually support a stronger cipher.  I have seen this happen in situations where a server was configured to choose RC4 as their primary cipher in response to the BEAST attack.  Instead of bombarding systems with scans for RC4 (such as through ssl-enum-ciphers in nmap), how about this:\n\nStep 1) Firefox attempts to handshake with the following cipher suites, which I believe is the standard in nightly:\n\nTLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02b)\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f)\nTLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc00a)\nTLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xc009)\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xc013)\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc014)\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x0033)\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x0039)\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x002f)\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x0035)\n\nIf those fail (ssl_error_no_cypher_overlap), we attempt to do another handshake with RC4 behind the scenes:\n\nTLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA (0xc007)\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA (0xc011)\nTLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA (0x0005)\nTLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 (0x0004)\n\nIf that succeeds, we tear down the session without making any HTTP requests, present the error page and give them the option to continue onward, should they accept the risks.  We would still present the gray triangle (or whatever) in such a case.",

Plus, at the point of the conversation where this screen would be displayed, no actual RC4 has even been done yet.  :)\n\nIn any case, it's a moot point: being able to decrypt the conversation means they have your session information and any number of other pieces of private information.\n\nI'll go ahead and post my stuff to the other thread as well.",

There are two spots in the tree that can use it directly.\n\nWherever it makes sense, we should (which is kind of tautological). I wouldn't bend over backwards, but if the start and end markers are in the same scope already, then I think it is worth it so we don't have to remember to end at every return.\n\n> Another question is whether it makes sense to handle TimelineMarker\n> subclasses\n> using this class.  I think subclasses will be the most typical way to\n> interact\n> with the timeline feature, because it's generally best to send along some\n> extra data associated with a marker.\n\nSo I started with a template that took the derived TimelineMarker and forwarded arguments to to it in the ctor, but then ran into the issue of when the start and end take a different set of parameters, and then realized I didn't know if that was even an issue or not, and then realized I was way too deep in theoretical issues and that I wasn't even going to use TimelineMarker subclasses for the HTML parsing markers. So I just backed up and did the simplest thing possible.\n\nSo, I think it would make sense to support derived classes, but I'm not sure exactly what it would look like, and I feel like it might involve more changes to the markers themselves as well.",

This is all windows e10s, and all the screenshots say the browser is offline.  So, either the browser comes up without network connectivity, or the test framework is not waiting for it to realize that it is connected.  Either way, this seems beyond the scope of what the test itself should be dealing with.\n\nShall we disable the test on windows e10s?  Other suggestions?",

Any ideas what we could try?\n\nSorry for the delay in getting back to you. I was out of the office for most of last week and am still getting back up to speed.\n\nAnyway, there's a few approaches you can Try (based on what I've seen other devs do):\n* Try adding logging to the test to figure out where things are going wrong. For a test that's failing as often as this is, it would hopefully work well. You can do it with a Try push or an actual in-tree push.\n* Get a loaner slave and try to reproduce the failures and debug there. (https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/How_To/Request_a_slave)\n\nAlso, you might take a look at the MDN page for test writing to see if anything there stands out for how these tests are written:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Avoiding_intermittent_oranges\n\nHope that helps.",

Franziskus is still investigating on how we can resolve this\n> intermittents. If you have any suggestions how to go about this, please let\n> us know. At the moment we are following suggestion from Comment 485.\n\nFrom looking at some of the build screenshots it looks like the context menu isn't opening / staying up. From looking at the code, I have two suggestions:\n\n1) make the test wait for the new window actually being closed (move promiseWindowWillBeClosed from ../general/head.js to BrowserTestUtils and use that, and .then() chain the starting of the next test)\n2) make the test either retry opening the context menu if it detects it being hidden (ie also add a hide listener, and just redo the thing you did to trigger it), and/or check if the tests can't be made to work while the context menu is closed. I'm not sure doCommand really depends on the menu being visible.",

Which means that nothing takes care of cleaning up parent actors when the server is disconnected.\nWhat I've been doing for top-level protocol.js actors is add this:\n\n  /**\n   * Since <something>Actor doesn't have a protocol.js parent actor that takes\n   * care of its lifetime, implementing disconnect is required to cleanup.\n   */\n  disconnect: function() {\n    this.destroy();\n  },\n\ndisconnect is called automatically by the debugger server (see ActorPool.cleanup).\nThen up to you to add anything you want in destroy.\n\nMy understanding of release is it's more useful for short-lived actors that the client knows when to create and destroy. So for example, the client-side right now receives new NodeActors when new DOM nodes have to be displayed in the inspector-panel, and the inspector-panel knows when it doesn't need them anymore, so it calls release, which is a special protocol.js method that simply calls destroy if there's one.\n\nSo I don't think you should be adding release to InspectorActor, but instead add the disconnect method I suggested.",

The TabActor receives a detach request that isn't observable by other tools.\n\nSo that I think adding a disconnect method on InspectorActor will help handling USB cable pulling,\nbut shouldn't fix the issue I'm seeing in WebIDE/luciddream when opening a toolbox twice against the same app.",

We really want to destroy tab actor on detach\nand later recreate some new ones on attach.\nIn order to do that, we have to make it so that connectToChild reports the actor form\nas disconnected/detached.\nIn this patch I make it so that aOnDisconnect is also called on detach.\n\nhttps://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=aed5b1b04e60",

The nodePrincipal change is similar - I create a new principal via its URI.spec, ie:\n\n>      // re-create the principal as it may be a CPOW.\n>      let principalURI = Services.io.newURI(aPrincipal.URI.spec, null, null);\n>      let principalToCheck = Services.scriptSecurityManager.getNoAppCodebasePrincipal(principalURI);\n\nbut it's less clear to me that this is OK.\n\nMike, I'm picking on you because I know how helpful you are ;) If you aren't confident saying if these changes are acceptable or not, could you please request feedback from someone you think would be?",

Current telemetry tests are broken in lots of ways and my fix causes a seemingly unrelated crash in another part of our codebase.

Bug 1098374 is about accessing the actual telemetry data and reading the real results rather that relying on monkeypatching our telemetry module.\n\nThe problem is that the patch that fixes this causes aborts in histogram.cc e.g.\n10:37:35 INFO - [1945] ###!!! ABORT: file /builds/slave/fx-team-l64-d-0000000000000000/build/src/ipc/chromium/src/base/histogram.cc, line 732\n\nSeems like a platform bug but it is on me to narrow it down and write a simple test case.\n\nOf course, it only happens on try.",

Unfortunately, the <pattern> are broken in the anonymous content, we probably should file a bug about it, so I ended up do dynamically create a path with all the segment we need. The downside is, for the moment, we need a fixed size for each rules.\n\nCurrently the zoom is not handled, but I used a workaround to have the line's path width always 1px; it's better than before, and I think it's a good tradeoff / starting point.",

So the command file name should be changed, and the command name and highlight class too.\n\nOther than this, I've applied the patch locally and played with it. It works nicely.\nAbout the 2 limitations:\n- fixed size: I was able to get to the end of the vertical ruler only on a huuuuge page, and I don't think that's a problem that should prevent landing. I'm guessing that most of the use cases for this tool is going to be when users work on mockups or template pages that don't necessarily have huge content in them. I don't really see a need for measuring stuff at 20000px below the top of the page. So I'm OK with it, and we can file a follow-up bug to investigate ways to make this infinite (can you file the bug please? make it depend on this one, and CC me on it please).\n- zooming: not a big deal either. The dimension adapt correctly, and the graduations stay sharp. So the only problem is that the ruler and text becomes bigger. But again, we can live with this and file a follow-up bug for it too (same as before, could you please file and cc me on it?)\n\nLast, we need tests for this. First of all, we need a command test that really just tests the output of the command and the autocompletion when given various inputs.\nSee /browser/devtools/commandline/test/browser_cmd_highlight_01.js for an example\nAnd we need tests for the highlighter itself. All our highligther-related tests are in /browser/devtools/inspector/test and the filenames all start with browser_inspector_highlighter*\nYou can look at the ones I've added for the geometry highlighter recently for instance.\n\n::: browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/devtools/gclicommands.properties\n@@ +1536,5 @@\n> +rulesDesc=Toggle rulers for the page\n> +\n> +# LOCALIZATION NOTE (rulesManual) A fuller description of the 'rules'\n> +# command, displayed when the user asks for help on what it does.\n> +rulesManual=Toggle rulers for the current page\n\nMaybe elaborate a bit more, like: \"Toggle the horizontal and vertical rulers for the current page\"\n\n::: toolkit/devtools/gcli/commands/rules.js\n@@ +1,4 @@\n> +/* This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n> + * License, v. 2.0.

With the light theme for instance, it's really hard to see the hover state. I see the icon almost as black, and I don't really see it change color when I hover over it. I see the other icons a little bit lighter and the difference between default and hover state easier to see.\nI've made a screenshot to show this: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/714210/dark-icon.png\nIn this screenshot, the first line shows 3 toolbar icons, with no hover effects,\nthe second line shows the same icons, with the eye-dropper being hovered,\nand the third, with the rulers icon hovered.\nIf I measure the darkest color of other icons when they aren't hovered, I find #555550.

I have tested with other icons, and it turns out the screenshot icon is also a lot darker than the others. So we're not consistent here.

Maybe there's some other solution where we change the size based on res, and still let the user change the block size, because this one will be tricky to have look good in all scenarios, I think. Or we can go even bigger, because the user can always scroll up/down on the flames, but they can't increase the \"zoom\" [currently anyway].\n\nWith the brightness/opacity changes (esp in dark theme), the blocks are too dark/hard to distinguish from differences in colors between each other -- would prefer the older brightness/opacity, as I don't think that this improves readability (I think the contrast is more stark now too, making it a bit hard to read)\n\nWith tests passing, a revert to the opacity/brightness unless there's strong feelings otherwise, and see if making the blocks even bigger helps, like 1.25x what is here, r+.\n\nWe should try and get f+ from someone on linux/windows.",

The sequence of events is:\n\nJitcode J is compiled.\nSample S is taken of of jitcode J.  Entry for J is marked as sampled.\nProfiler is stopped, jitcode J becomes non-live (doesn't matter what order these happen in).\nGarbage collection runs - cleaning up entry for jitcode J since profiler is off.\nProfiler is started again.\nProfiler streams samples, trying to stream sampled S from before.\nBut entry for sample S is gone since it got garbage collected.\n\nI have a patch that should fix it (flushing the sample buffers on profiler stop), which _is_ getting executed.. but the problem is still showing up.

The sampler makes ProfileBuffers for two uses:\n  1) The async (e.g., normal) case - as a circular buffer for sampling.\n  2) The sync case - as a buffer to hold a backtrace when the main thread calls profiler_get_backtrace().\n\nnsRefreshDriver calls profiler_get_backtrace() to synchronously capture backtraces at reflow and restyle (?) times, into mReflowCause and mStyleCause.\n\nThe problem is that these backtraces may be live across a ***GC during which the profiler is disabled***. In that case, the JS engine is free to discard all its JIT code profiling map stuff since, well, the profiler is disabled.\n\nThe synchronous case (case 2 above) should not be using the same code paths at all, really. It really needs to be serialized up front.

The debugging strings shouldn't be sent, as those would have to be localized, and don't provide much more information than the constant name (so, not make sense outside of JIT engineers).

I have noticed some bugs too. But it's just so convenient for a nice multi-line editing widget that I thought I'd give this a try.\n> Even after bug 1153237 is\n> fixed, I found a bug in your testcase w/o any effort.\nOh, yeah, I'm sure you did.

There is another instance created once and cached for autocompletion in the prompt: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/webconsole.js#874.\n\nIf you look at the constructor of JSTermHelpers, all it really does is define properties on the sandbox object passed in.  These come in different forms - functions like '$$' are easy since they can just return an object from the owner's window.  Some are more complicated, like 'inspect', which returns a helper result so that the frontend can do some custom processing with it: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webconsole/webconsole.js#3337.  It depends on what you need these to do: \n\n1) Functions that return a result to be displayed in the webconsole should be relatively easy to extend.. we could provide some mechanism to register a JSTermHelper extension that would be called at the end of the constructor.  It could look something like:\n\n  JSTermHelpers.extend(aOwner => {\n    aOwner.sandbox.foobar = arg1 => { return arg1 + \"foobar\"; }\n\n    Object.defineProperty(aOwner.sandbox, \"$1\", {\n      get: function() {\n        return aOwner.makeDebuggeeValue(aOwner.selectedNode)\n      }\n    });\n  });\n\n2) Functions that need to some custom processing on the frontend (like add a button to a result, change what messages are displayed, copy text to the clipboard, etc) we would need an alternate plan.

We still slow down the requests when the netmonitor is opened.\n\nFrom some testing, the next thing that looks promising would be to make _onNetworkEvent async, queue up events to send to the list, and dispatch them all at once.  AFAICT anything sync that is happening there (like NetMonitorView.RequestsMenu.addRequest) is janking the request time.\n\nIt's surprising *how* slow inserting items into this list is given the small number of requests (< 1000).  I think it's the flex layout on the netmonitor view that's contributing to that, because I had a test case that did the same kind of scrolling / inserting behavior that this does, but with a more simple DOM and it had no problem keeping up even with 10s of thousands of elements.",

Right now this fires early sometimes, since it doesn't take into account dead requests for RECEIVED events.  In order to make that work, I'm waiting to fire these events until after the update queue has been processed (which is when dead requests are detected).\n2) Adding an event that fires when a request is added and using that in a couple tests as necessary (if they weren't using waitForNetworkEvents)\n3) A few optimizations (getting rid of unnecessary calls to refresh zerbra striping and summary stats for every new request since that can fire once at the end of flushRequests)\n\nStill awaiting try results (https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=1824d4cad377), but everything is passing locally.\n\nAs we discussed on IRC, I'm not sure offhand how much this will interfere with the refactoring in Bug 1149634, but I'm hoping we can at least land (1) ASAP since I think it may fix Bug 1163775 and maybe some other intermittent issues.

There's actually a logging bug that got introduced there where progress isn't going to be correctly reported in the test logs for the RECEIVED events since they aren't passing in [actor,url] right now.

Can you grab a build from June 11 or 12 and do a quick test?  Here is a build directory https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2015-06-11-03-02-08-mozilla-central/.

It's possible I guess that if the web server is running slower then requests won't be batched up as well.  If that's the case, I'd like to know if the June 11 build is faster than the latest Nightly.\n\nIt's also possible that you had e10s on with the builds you just tested and not on with the other computer, which could explain this type of behavior (with multiprocess, any jank in our frontend shouldn't affect the page).  This can be toggled in about:preferences.\n\n> This is an awesome performance change! This is soo cool.

While I could see some performance differences, I could not say exactly which one is faster. I got 3 consecutive runs where the June 11 was faster, then 4 consecutive where the latest was faster and then all over again. The difference was small between the two and I consider them equally fast.\n\n> It's also possible that you had e10s on with the builds\n\nI had e10s on both OSs. The Fedora 22 Nightly I tested with the first time might have been \"dirty\" :P It was actually a Firefox GTK3 build upgraded to the latest Nightly and I had several updates on top of that. The latest Nightly works fine so I don't think we should focus on this anymore.\n\n> Yes, thank you for making the report and the test case!\n\nI consider this bug fixed but I might create several performance bug reports in the future :) I'm surprised of how performance issues can be fixed if provided a good test case.\n\nRegarding the bounty....
