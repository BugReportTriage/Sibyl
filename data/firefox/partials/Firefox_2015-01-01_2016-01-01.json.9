Once including the plotFPS in both of these tests (copied in both files, which isn't great, but they're tests and it's fine), rerunning the tests should pass!",

One difference here is that the data source is a plain old object, while the variable view deals with value grips from the server.  There are some features that the current VariablesView has that would need to be added before a switch could happen (like change flashing, inline editing, tooltips, and upcoming large object handling in Bug 1023386).  \n\nI wonder if there's a way to adapt some of the new frontend ideas into that existing widget so we can share any future improvements across the features - sort of swapping out the 'Scope' and 'Variable' classes.  I'm not familiar enough with either code base to say whether that'd be sane.",

Markup that can be simply themed and we can do support for Light, Dark and also for other custom themes like Firebug. It isn't about replacing VariablesView.\n\nHere is an example: rendering preview of jQuery data in a tooltip, which is displayed within the Markup view. Content of the tooltip should display syntax-colored JSON object preview. The tooltip (shared/widgets/tooltip) already knows how to render content using HTML (through setIFrameContent  [2]) and all which is needed to do is just provide the markup. It's just straightforward to use ReactJS for the transformation JSON -> HTML. Also my gut feeling is that using VariablesView in the tooltip wouldn't fit so well. Also note that contents of the tooltip is rendered within an iframe with type=\"content\" (as a step towards UI that is entirely running inside type=\"cotent\" scope) VariablesView needs chrome privileges.\n\n\n> but I'm working on React stuff right now.\n> There are several things that need to be improved in these React components.\n> More importantly I'm developing a careful strategy for introducing React\n> into devtools and this doesn't really jive with it.\nI'd love to know more about the strategy you are working on and see how things should be done,\nso they fit into it.

E.g. customizing the Console or Markup View - by injecting React into the appropriate panel frames and using it's API or creating new frame (e.g. for the aforementioned tooltip).\n\n\n> We'll get the most out of React when we use\n> it to layout and control each tool's UI and state, not just replacing\n> individual components.\nSounds good to me.\n\n\n> So I'm not exactly sure where this fits into the picture; I don't want to\n> spend months rewriting our individual components because everyone will\n> wonder what the actual benefit was. However, when we use React to *compose*\n> various components and control the state of our debugger UI, you'll see the\n> benefits very quickly.\n\nTo finish the picture I started describing above. In order to render JSON bits (in all those mentioned add-ons) I created set of small React templates (that's what you could see in the 'reps' directory). It works even in content scope with no privileges (no XUL no chrome API). And since the \"JSON Viewer\" is based on stream-convertor approach where the logic lives in-content (under the same URL from where the original JSON comes from), it feels like a fitting approach to use React and existing templates since it doesn't need chrome privileges (VariablesView requires chrome scope).\n\nAnother example: The same set of templates can be later use for rendering objects within the Console panel or anywhere else in the UI - at some point we could have, step by step, one unified way how objects are rendered within the Toolbox UI. VariablesView can use it to render object's values (it's currently just plain text) or even for the layout in the future when we decide that it's the right time.\n\n\nIn any case, I am open for any suggestions or better approaches!\n\n\n> A few comments:\n> \n> * Uppercasing the DOM elements unnecessary.

I'll start writing tests as soon as we agree on the concept we want to use to build it.\nBtw.

I suppose we have bits of code around to do that, but that is a lot easier than VariablesView.\n\nIt's fine to make a new thing for sure, but I'm still hesitant to introduce React at the bottom of the stack like this. If you want to offer it for devtools extensions, that's awesome. When we get to the point of replacing parts of our individual components, this will exist and we can take it and use it.\n\nMy worry is that we have limited resources, and I want them to be spent on refactoring our code so that React can be front and center, not just for individual components. I know that I don't really have to help develop this because I'm working on cleaning up the debugger for a future react/flux architecture.

I was planning on wrapping a lot of our existing widgets in React components, because you could get far really fast.\n\n> \n> Another example: The same set of templates can be later use for rendering\n> objects within the Console panel or anywhere else in the UI - at some point\n> we could have, step by step, one unified way how objects are rendered within\n> the Toolbox UI.

Having a bunch of low-level components in React isn't really going to help our current tools, if anything it might make it more awkward because if a tool doesn't leverage React itself it's going to be awkward to compose React components. \n\nWe need to experiment with various architectures first which I'm (in a careful way) doing with the debugger, where React has a role within the tool itself. I've discovered that it's actually more important to adopt a Flux-style architecture first and then we can talk about React.\n\nBut even deciding on that feels a good ways off, which is why I'm hesitant to even begin to start adopting low-level React components.\n\nLet's definitely meet and talk about it.",

It's a very scoped feature:\n\n - it's not part of the toolbox\n - it's not going to be enabled by default except on dev edition\n - for our users, anything we do here is going to be better than what we ( and chrome ) currently do, so it can be a prototype with some known issues and still be useful.\n\nIt's really just a cool developer-oriented browser based on user feedback[1] and especially the dominance of addons that implement this feature in both Firefox and Chrome. Chrome's json viewer addons have millions of viewers[2].\n\nFor what it's worth, I think of this project as an experiment in the small for doing UI differently, based on Honza's work in addons. It's not meant to be a project that leverages existing code or development methods. I do really appreciate getting Jame's feedback on the use of react though, and generally everyone's feedback as we go along.\n\nHonza: when it gets to be time, I'd love to have try builds to test.\n\n[1] http://ffdevtools.uservoice.com/forums/246087-firefox-developer-tools-ideas/suggestions/6413798-show-json-as-structured-data-just-like-xml-files\n[2] https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/JSON?_category=extensions",

Some notes:\n\n* when I copy the raw response using the copy command, the text when pasted is pretty-printed. Do you think it should instead be whatever the state is in the raw response view? Meaning if the JSON is all on a single line, we should copy that to the clipboard, but if the JSON has been pretty-printed, we should instead copy the pretty-printed text. My idea here is that when the user clicks on the copy button they get the current state that they see in front of them\n\n* do you think clicking on 'pretty print' a second time should revert to the non-pretty-printed  text?\n\n* I thought it was strange that the headers are shown Response first, then Request, but when I click copy they are request, then Response.

We're at least going to refactor some of the debugger to use it (after my first pass refactoring lands, which is sooner than you think). Long term we can remove it for some reason we decide to go without it, but after Whistler it seems like most people are comfortable with it.\n\nI'm going to file a new bug to get it committed. There are a few things to figure out, like loading the dev version for local builds, but I talked with a few people today and we know how to do that, it's just a matter to putting it together.\n\nI'll make sure that lands soon so this isn't blocked on it.

I would consider this my full review, sorry it took so long to actually do :( I did r- only because I think the Reps class could be cleaned up a lot, and actually would be simpler as just a component. Read my comment and let me know. That's the only major change.\n\nOnce we address that and some other nits are address, I'll definitely r+ this.

I would remove them if they aren't used anywhere. I'd rather start with a minimal API.\n\nThe bigger issue though is I think the primary purpose of `Reps` should be available as a component, not a `getRep` method. Here's a more React-like way to do it:\n\n1. At the top of reps.js, import all of the components that render out types (undefined, null, array, etc). You already do that in `repository.js`. Get rid of `repository.js` and just do all those imports at the top of the file here. This assumes that you've already changed those components to not register themselves anywhere; they just export a component and a `supportsObject` function.\n\n2. Group the above imported components into an array. So, it would look like this so far:\n\nconst Undefined = require('./undefined');\nconst Null = require('./null');\n...\n\nconst tags = [Undefined, Null, ...];\n\n3. Create a `Rep` component that takes a `value` property. Within the render method, find the appropriate tag for that value. You would basically implement the same code in `getRep` here but reference `tags` instead. Just render that component with the current props;\n\nconst Rep = React.createClass({\n  getRep: function(value) { /* look through tags, etc */ };\n\n  render: function() {\n    const rep = this.getRep(this.props.value);\n    return rep(this.props);\n  }\n});\n\n4. Then, whenever you want to render a value, just do `Rep({ value: value, <any other props> })`\n\nThere's most likely errors in the above code, but it's just to give you the idea.

I am seeing this as well.\n\n> I think we need to figure out the core problem or clone the Loader.jsm into\n> temp module. Would this be acceptable for you as a workaround?\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think we should accept cloning Loader.jsm.  That file is at the heart of how we load the tools, and is already confusing enough with just one version.  Keeping track of another sounds dangerous to me.\n\nAnyway, I've made some more discoveries.  In Loader.jsm, we set the following:\n\n  invisibleToDebugger: Services.appinfo.name !== \"Firefox\"\n\nSo, since we are running Firefox, it should be set to \"false\".  That's indeed what used to happen.\n\nHowever, your changes now trigger Loader.jsm from a process script, which is the first time we've done that.  It appears that the child process does not have any `appinfo` data until **after** process scripts are run[1].  So, since we're now first invoking Loader.jsm in child from a process script, it's set to true there.\n\nIt seems like a bug, either in the test or in functionality, that the web console test fails when `invisibleToDebugger === true`.  I filed bug 1213427 to investigate why this failure happens.\n\nHowever, it does not seem appropriate to just disable the test.  It also does not seem good to just allow it to become `invisibleToDebugger === true` in the child process, since this break debugging of DevTools files that are loaded in the child.\n\nIt seems we need to construct a way to set `invisibleToDebugger` to false for all desktop Firefox processes, but without using `appinfo`.\n\n[1]: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/d01dd42e654b8735d86f9e7c723cc869a3b56798/dom/ipc/ContentParent.cpp#2538",

The problem is that the tab switcher sometimes switches to the new tab immediately if we've already been waiting a long time for the current tab to load and it still hasn't loaded. After the switcher runs, we call updateCurrentBrowser, which then unfocuses the current tab (which is actually the new tab), thinking that we'll focus it when we switch to it. But that never happens.\n\nThe fix is to avoid the blurring behavior if we've already switched. We don't need to call _adjustFocusAfterTabSwitch because the switcher already did that when it switched.",

If I select an entry and press right, I'd expect the selected entry to be completed, so I can keep typing after it, but it won't be completed anymore.\n\nMaybe we should make it be if (noRollup && \"CompleteSelectedIndex\"), so basically noRollup will only work for CompleteSelectedIndex fields?\n\nAlternatively, isn't the problem here the call to\ninput->SelectTextRange(value.Length(), value.Length());\nthis seems to make sense only when the cursor is already at the end before we setTextIndex, would changing that make sense more generally for autocomplete fields?",

It will probably still work as intended, since either the breakpoint actor was already pending before the page navigation, or it was not. In the latter case, it was set on a location for which at least one script had an offset, so when the new version of that script is introduced, no breakpoint sliding should occur.\n\nThat said, it probably wouldn't hurt to make this more explicit by making isPending a boolean that defaults to true and is set to false the first time addScript is called.",

Since the two different locations are otherwise completely the same in terms of what properties they have, how about this instead: define two derived properties on location, called isOriginalLocation and isGeneratedLocation, so we can assert on those directly.

The problem with that is that the breakpoint-actor-map-test.js doesn't use proper location objects (it uses dummy objects instead of proper actors, so we can't pass an actor ID to the location constructor), and I haven't figured out yet how to work around that cleanly.

However, now that I've thought about it some more, I can see the point of adding a name property to OriginalLocation, so I've readded the code.\n\nI'm still not completely happy with this though, since a name technically isn't part of a location and is only ever used for display purposes in the tracer. I might come up with a cleaner way to do this in the future, but for now, let's just leave it as is.",

I'm going to land this patch as it is (with the jar.mn fix), and we can investigate this more in another bug if it continues to be an issue.\n\n> ::: browser/base/content/browser.xul\n> (Diff revision 2)\n> > -                       class=\"urlbar-icon\"\n> > +                               class=\"tabbable\"\n> \n> It's vaguely sad that the urlbar-icon class is useless / actively harmful\n> here, because semantically it should be making sense...

Service.enabled is now a getter that reflects the state of the pref. The pref has a default of true and is only set to false by the UI bits (in part 2). I also needed to add one more check for the enabled state as enginesync.js threw when .enabled was false, which I suspect is simply due to it being rarely tested that way. Note that we *do* still need to initialize the identity object even when disabled as browserid_identity has magic we need but can't reasonably refactor in time for reading-list.",

STR:\n1) On a clean profile, enable privacy.trackingprotection.enabled\n2) Wait 30 seconds and visit http://people.mozilla.org/~mchew/test_tp.html. You should see a bunch of empty boxes.

GetChannelResultPrincipal() returns the owner if available - http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/caps/nsIScriptSecurityManager.idl#190 .  My guess as to why this came up now and not earlier is that we are adding loadInfo to more and more channels.  In GetChannelResultPrincipal() we use the loadInfo if we have it, and fallback to GetChannelURIPrincipal() if we don't.  So I assume that the channel didn't have a loadInfo before and does now.",

The local blocklist check happens using nsHttpChannel->GetPrincipal. This is important, because it doesn't fallback to GetChannelResultPrincipal unless the appId is required, which in our case, it isn't. So ClassifyLocal has always used the correct principal for blocklist lookups.\n\nAfter bug 1122691, we call nsChannelClassifier::Start for all URIs unless they are cancelled, in order to catch the phishing and malware cases. So, the resource being loaded from fbcdn.net is going through nsChannelClassifier::Start in case it is phishing or malware.\n\nSometime between https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/25d9ba8ceb7a (landed 1/14) and now, GetChannelResultPrincipal changed behavior in a way that we are inheriting the parent resource (facebook.com) for fbcdn.net, resulting in an incorrect classification.\n\nI believe that the original patch is still the correct fix for this.",

That's how phishing has always worked - it juts suspend's the channel until it figures out if it needs to cancel it or not - preventing the consumer from ever seeing malware. That suspend doesn't really stop the socket thread from doing its thing (at least until some buffering back pressure builds up). And I would assert that's a good thing.\n\nTracking protection piggy backed on that, but unfortunately as you point out - its not enough to keep the consumer away from the tracking site's response - we need to prevent the request. And that's what monica's change sought to do by deferring the BeginConnect() part of the channel in the case where a url got a hit on the synchronous local list.. deferring it until it could be looked up in the full list asynchronously.\n\nThat is going to slow stuff down - hopefully just a little bit - because now the local check is serialized with starting the networking rather than being done in parallel with it. (And there is a lot idle cpu time involved in the networking - so best to get it started asap). otoh that's kind of the point of the feature.",

There was a need for a GetChannelURIPrincipal() that returned the codebase principal, instead of the channel's owner in nsCORSProxyListener (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1038756#c24).\n\nHttpBaseChannel::GetPrincipal was added in Bug 974018 to get redirect history.  It has always called GetChannelPrincipal()/GetChannelResultPrincipal().  To determine if you want GetChannelURIPrincipal() instead, you have to evaluate the callers of GetPrincipal to identify if they expect the channel owner's principal or the principal of the uri that is being loaded.  Either way, we should clearly document which principal is being returned in both HttpBaseChannel::GetPrincipal and in GetChannel*Principal().",

(makes sense to me based on this thread, but I'm not the expert\n> here.)\n\nYes, this function should likely use GetChannelURIPrincipal as well (I assume that's what you meant to ask).\n\nBut it depends on what the consumers of this function actually use the principal for. I.e. which principal they are expecting to get.\n\nGetChannelResultPrincipal() returns the principal that the resource will have once it has been downloaded and parsed. This is affected by who loads the resource, and how it's loaded. For example a resource inside a <iframe sandbox> will always return a nullprincipal for GetChannelResultPrincipal().\n\nGetChannelURIPrincipal() returns the principal for the URI which is loaded. In a sense it's the principal for the server. It is not affected by who or how a resource is loaded.\n\nThen there's the triggeringPrincipal and loadingPrincipal, which both live on the nsILoadInfo on the channel. They are documented on nsIIOService.newChannel2.\n\nSo it would probably be good to rename HttpBaseChannel::GetPrinicipal to something more specific.",

It had 3 arguments, now has 4, and that seems to be what's being passed...\n\nSeems to me (without having run this) that it's more likely that in tests the contentWindow.document ref is null and so we're passing null as the owning document, which newChannelFromURI2 doesn't like... in any case, it should be easy to test either of these hypotheses with the JS debugger ( --jsdebugger) and a conditional breakpoint in the relevant code.",

Want to file a followup to ensure we always call it (probably with |null|) and deal with that in the relevant callbacks? :-)",

Suggestions are supposed to guess what I am typing, and that's independent from the search engine I use. (As a developer, I understand that's not at all how it works. I am describing the mental model of a *user*.)",

The mock of concept two focuses the ui to emphasize unique providers that could surface things a lot faster then having to just land on their page and start searching again.\n\nThe current UI, when you click any of the providers doesn't respect any of the suggestions unless you use the arrow keys to select a result and then click the provider. This interaction to me feels complicated and like it isn't reflecting a strong mental model. Therefore I think its worth 'exploring via a prototype.' \n\nI also think there is a value to having predicative suggestions or rich results for the other types of providers (ie. wikipedia, twitter, yelp, etc) since the content can be quite different from what your default search provider might surface.",

This is fixed in mozilla-central, so if you downloaded a nightly from https://nightly.mozilla.org/ now it would have your fix in it.

It has \"TEST-PASS\"s, then the\n> message from comment 110, then the passage of time, then the timeout message.\n\nYeah... Jared, I still suspect that the setTimeout'd unload thing has a hand in this. The window gets destroyed pointing to applicationManager.xul (which is the second URL we use). Specifically, I think this sequence is happening:\n\n1) we open the first URL\n2) we close the dialog by clicking OK\n\nthis dispatches the dialogclosing event, which we keep and store, and then calls window.close .\n\nthis will call gSubDialog.close()\n\nthis removes all our listeners (!) and indicates we're closing\n\nthis does a setTimeout with a timeout value of 0 that will cause about:blank to be loaded instead of the current document;\n\nthen we have this yield:\n\n  list = yield waitForCondition(() => win.document.getAnonymousElementByAttribute(ourItem, \"class\", \"actionsMenu\"));\n\nwhich AIUI should wait at least 100ms (which is assuming timeouts are deterministic, which we know they're not).\n\n\n3) we open the second URL... and readd all the listeners in one go.\n\n\n\nI can think of two possible things which explain the log from comment 130:\n\na) the unload somehow races with the condition and while we first open with the second URL, then the loadURI call gets run and we replace it with about:blank, which closes all the things through the unload handler that we attach, and kills the load of the JS file as well.\nb) some unknown thing kills the JS file which somehow causes the load of the document to never fire (before that, because of our opacity hacks, you won't see the new dialog that *has* been opened, AFAICT...)\n\nI've tried to verify (a) with the try push in comment #128, but it seems win7 debug isn't being run for whatever reason (maybe I'll be lucky when I wake up tomorrow morning?).\n\nJared, thoughts? At least for (a), it seems to me we could avoid it ever happening by checking in the function we setTimeout whether a new load is already pending? Is that crazy talk, and/or can you think of something better, and/or do you think there's anything wrong with my reasoning and/or can you think of any reasons besides (a) and (b) ? :-)",

Is the event handler for\n> onKeyDown/ESC not able to prevent the load-stop of about:blank?\n\nI mean, the assertion from the code there, which has been there since Matt wrote this originally, is that if we don't do it on a timeout, closing a subdialog with the esc key would bust things because it stops the about:blank load and we keep the dialog loaded.\n\n> What if we just created a new subdialog each time a subdialog is opened,\n> thus making closing it a lot simpler and removing state that has to be\n> cleaned up between showings?\n\nThis could kind of work but we currently have a gSubDialog thing whose ._frame always refers to the same DOM element, and we're always using the dialogFrame element instead of a new element each time. Breaking some of those invariants seems scary to me...\n\nI noticed that the open() call returns a reference to the window we've just opened, but no code (not even add-ons!) seems to depend on this right now. So I have a patch that just makes open() deal with a different thing still being loaded / unloaded, and waiting for that to complete (including the about:blank load on a timeout). That seems like a smaller and thereby safer change... It makes open() async, but it already kind of is, apart from that return value, so that seems OK.\n\nThat said, I'd like to write specific tests for some of this, and that's why no patch is up yet, sorry.",

This change is fundamental for access keys, since many localization tools use the entity name to connect an access key to its label, for example to check if it's using a character not available in the original string: given entities \"useBookmark.label\" and \"useBookmark.accesskey\", if you change to \"chooseBookmark.label\" due to a string change, change the access key entity to \"chooseBookmark.accesskey\" to match it.\n\"\n\nwhich makes me think that the word \"accesskey\" in the property name is important, and so we shouldn't change it.\nFrancesco? Any guidelines here?",

Unlike shortcuts (or commankeys), you need to match the label. \n\"Show\" with a fixed accesskey \"w\" wouldn't work in Italian, since \"w\" it's not available in the translation \"Visualizza\".\n\n2) Yes, it's important to keep \".accesskey\" to help tools figure out the association between label and accesskey. Not sure if they're smart enough to understand \".accesskey1\", probably not.\n\n3) Most important: you don't need to change the ID, simply update the accesskey for English. Given #1, each locale will have a completely different set of accesskeys, and they need to figure out on their own how to avoid conflicts.",

But after landing bug 1121340, I think using the default APP_INFO in AppInfo.jsm will break some xpcshell tests. Though it did not break anything for now actually as far as I can push it on try server.",
