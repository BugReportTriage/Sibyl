This component asks[2] UserAgentOverrides if there is an override, and only caches a mapping per host\n3. UserAgentOverrides[3] stores the active overrides per domain\n\nSo, on the surface at least, it seems like the main change is improving these components to be window / tab specific, instead of operating on a whole domain.\n\n[1]: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/ba44099cbd07/dom/base/Navigator.cpp#l2734\n[2]: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/ba44099cbd07/dom/base/SiteSpecificUserAgent.js#l40\n[3]: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/UserAgentOverrides.jsm",

The other is what UA strings are sent on the wire.\n\nFor the former, comment 4 describes the data flow.  Note that SiteSpecificUserAgent.js is passed the URI of the page _and_ the window.  So it could in fact do window-specific or tab-specific bits there if it wanted to.  We'd need to change Navigator::GetUserAgent to ignore the UA override pref if in this devtools spoofing mode, I guess.\n\nFor the latter, that's handled entirely in UserAgentOverrides.jsm.  See the HTTP_on_modify_request function there.  That would need to be changed to examine the window in addition to the channel URI.  Or something.  It's not clear to me which process this stuff runs in in the e10s world and therefore whether it actually has access to a window when we're doing e10s.",

I don't think it's worth writing a comment, since a lot of other tests use the same pattern as well, without explanation. But if you insist, I can ask why it's needed and add a comment.\n\n> >+    nsIDocShell* mDocShell = mWindow->GetDocShell();\n> \n> Again, please don't name local variables with names starting with \"m\".\nSorry, missed that from the previous review.

On the down side, if there happens to be a site-specific UA override, it will stomp over our devtools override with this approach (but there seem to be very very few per-site overrides, and none on desktop).\n\nI'm ok with the .jsm approach if you think this one isn't good enough.",

Dozens of other notification bars are fine with the default style.\n\n> - I am glad that annoyance about how gross this is is pushing Chameleon\n> forward!\n\nI don't know that it really is unless someone actually works on it. I was against the one-off for translation from the beginning but that was around a year ago probably and we still are stuck with the tech-debt.\n\n> - I tested old notification bars.  These perform *much better*.  If they\n> didn't, clearly this work would be foolish.  That the new designs *do work*\n> should inform Chameleon.\n\nI didn't know you had tested old notification bars. This is all the more reason to implement Chameleon for all notification bars.\n\n> - Because this design rev is *also* instrumented, it will be easy to know\n> whether to revert it, or 'try again'.  \n\nI thought you just said above you already had data that these are better. We also already used Chamelon for translation notification bars. Why do we need more data?\n\n> - I agree that all the OSX specific stuff is gross.  Most the overrides here\n> are more like 'un-overrides', b/c OSX notification bars were filled with\n> overrides.  Figuring it out was horrendous.\n\nThat's because we're trying to fit in with the platform and that's why we have separate theme directories for each platform.\n\n> - I hope the 'one-off-ness' is 'contained' here.  It's in two files, to\n> cover one very specific case.\n\nIt's not contained when we make fixes to the notification bars e.g. bug 1047977 (which has to be special-cased for the 2 Chameleon notification bars).\n\n> - This is the test case for new notifacation bar designs.

We already had the translation notifications to test out Chameleon if we wanted to.\n\n> Technical Note:\n> - (we might be over importanting here.  Understanding the css cascade for\n> these bars (on OSX in particular) is Hard (for me at least!).\n\nUnnecessary !important adds technical debt too and makes it harder for add-ons to theme so that's what I want to make sure they're necessary.",

This patch just moves ThreadSources up into the tab actors (and renamed TabSources) and makes everything work with that move. This doesn't add any new functionality, it just refactors the code and makes sure everything still works.\n\nI need to wait for bug 1059308 to land before I finish the patch because that changes how the browser debugger works. The browser debugger will inherit from TabActor and get this for free, instead of now I'd have to manually patch the chrome debugger (and it's actually not clear to do it). That bug should land this week.\n\nNo need to review until I get that change in",

We've had to split some tests in 2 or more parts because of this. I'd like to make sure this doesn't slow down the tests too much when running them against a local tab as today.\n\nOtherwise, as discussed earlier, I like the approach of going through an actor to access the test page. May I suggest that we start adding a comment block in each head.js file in directories that use this technique (or have a README somewhere) that explains the setup? Also, this page will need to be updated: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Hacking#Running_the_Developer_Tools_Tests\nIndeed, people working on the devtools for the first time may be surprised if they've been writing browser mochitests before, so it needs to be obvious why we do this, and what it is.\n\nI haven't looked at all the details in this patch yet. I have looked at head.js, test-actor.js and doc_frame_script.js changes mostly. Those changes look good to me.\nFor the rest, it seems like boring, repetitive changes across all tests to move from local helpers or mm messages to testActor methods. So I'll look at those when you think it's ready for review. Also, TRY will be a lot better than me at finding problems for this type of changes.\n\n::: browser/devtools/inspector/test/browser_inspector_select-last-selected.js\n@@ +62,1 @@\n>        yield selectNode(nodeToSelect, inspector);\n\nselectNode already waits for the \"inspector-updated\" event, so why did you need to add another step to wait for \"new-node-front\" here?\n\n@@ +65,4 @@\n>      }\n>  \n> +    let onNewNodeFront = inspector.selection.once(\"new-node-front\");\n> +    yield navigateToAndWaitForNewRoot(toolbox, testActor, url);\n\nSame question here.",

But the code itself looks wrong. We shouldn't _always_ close the _current_ toolbox when receiving toolbox-close.

If you haven't done that yet, please see these links:\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide\n\nThere are two parts to this bug, about:home and about:newtab.\n\nFor about:home, you need to change \"tab\" on this line to \"tabshifted\": http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/modules/AboutHome.jsm?rev=2e9ff15fa9c7#201\n\nFor about:newtab, you need to remove these three lines: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/modules/ContentSearch.jsm?rev=2e9ff15fa9c7#229  As you can see, if `data` says to use a new tab, then we set the selected tab to the new tab.  We should just not do that anymore.\n\nAnd that should be it!  Once you've made your changes and you've tested them, you can attach your patch to this bug as described here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/How_to_Submit_a_Patch#Submitting_the_patch\n\nIf you need help generating a patch in the first place, check here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mercurial_FAQ#How_can_I_generate_a_patch_for_somebody_else_to_check-in_for_me.3F\n\nGood luck, let me know here in the bug when you have questions.",

You would enable memory/allocations tracking once you see long GC pauses.",

What was happening is the click test in browser_tab_dragdrop was leaving the mouse cursor in the middle of the screen then when browser_tabopen_reflows opens about:newtab the mouse is conveniently hovering over a tile for dummy_page.html because by that point in the test run that page has been loaded enough to show up. This causes the link status display to appear causing a reflow while it figures out whether the mouse is overlapping it or not.\n\nThe simplest solution I found was just to simulate a click outside of the tiled area in content before opening the new tab, try runs show this solves the problem. I also ended up converting this test to task based.",

So we can't really delay opening of the port. Bug 1087793 is probably the ideal solution here, if it is workable.",

Please test your changes and ask questions that you have while working on it. You can join #introduction on irc.mozilla.org to ask questions about getting your build running, or you can follow the steps at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build to build Firefox.\n\nWith this patch there are no arrows in the Preferences > Applications > richlistbox. This is because the selector needs to reference chrome://global/skin/in-content/dropdown.svg#dropdown instead of just chrome://global/skin/in-content/dropdown.svg.\n\nAlso, the size of the arrow is too small at height:8px, width:12px. The SVG here is square, and we can use width:16px; height:16px; for it.",

This isn't done on the first vbox as this is a bit special with not setting the selectedIndex attribute when the page opens on this vbox. After changing the vboxes in the deck it's used as selectedIndex=\"0\".

This means that we get this behaviour for free wherever we use the output parser to create color swatches.\n\nI worked around the problem with DOM Templater removing the listeners in the computed view by stopping using the DOM Templater for creating matched selectors.\n\nOf course I have used event.preventDefault() etc. to prevent highlight flickering.\n\nbgrins mentioned using a doubleclick event but we should copy Chrome here to make Chrome users feel warm and fuzzy.\n\nI have also removed the change from the cubic bezier tooltip.\n\nTry:\nhttps://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=3f81dff5e806",

In Hacking Devtools page [1] there's some guidance about how to submit a patch.

We could do that -- DirectoryLinksProvider already observes PlacesProvider -- or, since getEnhancedLink is the one public access point to _enhancedLinks, and it takes the original link object, how about just moving the link.type != \"history\" check into getEnhancedLink?  Then you don't have to update callers.\n\ni.e., in Site._render, keep it as it is now:\n\nlet enhanced = gAllPages.enhanced && DirectoryLinksProvider.getEnhancedLink(this.link);\n\nBut change getEnhancedLink like:\n\ngetEnhancedLink: function DirectoryLinksProvider_getEnhancedLink(link) {\n  return link.type == \"history\" ? null :\n         link.enhancedImageURI && link ? link :\n         this._enhancedLinks.get(NewTabUtils.extractSite(link.url));\n},\n\nWouldn't that work?

Let me explain:\n\n(1) In Bug 418354 Firefox started to block MixedContent that follows any kind of redirection.\n(2) Within Bug 1006868 we started to revamp the way content security checks are performed within Gecko. As a first step we attach a loadinfo to every channel at channel creation time which is also propagated if a channel goes through a redirect. A serious of patches (see Bug 1087720) makes sure that we attach such a loadinfo to every channel. One of them is indeed Bug 1087726.\n\nWhat does that mean?\nIf you click on any of the links provided on the testpage in Comment 2, you see the following message in the console:\n> Blocked loading mixed active content \"http://fdlyr.co/d/changelog/cdn.5by5.tv/audio/broadcasts/changelog/2015/changelog-155.mp3\"\n\nWhich is correct, because the main page is https and the redirect ends up at\n> http://cdn.5by5.tv/audio/broadcasts/changelog/2015/changelog-155.mp3\n\nNow why that message does not show up in the console if you 'right click - save link as ...' I can't tell - maybe Tanvi knows.",

Why not?\n\nYou are absolutely correct. Thanks for pointing that out, I just disabled mixed content and get the same error. So, after the channel gets redirected mixed content receives a call to AsyncOnChannelRedirect [1], which then calls ::ShouldLoad, which then returns an error because it cannot query a docshell [2]. That error than causes the channel to be aborted.\n\n[1] https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/security/nsMixedContentBlocker.cpp#210\n[2] https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/security/nsMixedContentBlocker.cpp#589",

The channel we're creating is a normal HTTP channel as far as I\n> know, not an nsIParentChannel.\n\nHey Bill,\n\nI'm having trouble reproducing this with https://jsfiddle.net/bdukes/mgw1mqyu/1/show/.  Not sure what the steps to reproduce are.  But from what I can gather:\n* You click \"save link as\" on a link that is https and redirects to http\n* When it redirects to http, nsMixedContentBlocker::AsyncOnChannelRedirect gets called.  AsyncOnChannelRedirect gets called on the child and the parent.\n* When it is called in the parent process, we skip the mixed content check (since 1. the child will perform the check for us and 2. we don't have the document).\n* When it is called in the child, we use the channel's loadInfo to extract the parameters needed to call nsMixedContentBlocker::ShouldLoad().  Specifically, we use the loadingNode as the aRequestingContext in ShouldLoad().  ShouldLoad() returns early for TYPE_DOCUMENT since mixed content pertains to a top level documents subresources, and not the top level document itself.  For TYPE_OTHER however, the ShouldLoad() code continues to execute.  In order for the code to do all the things it needs to do, we need to query the docshell here http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/security/nsMixedContentBlocker.cpp#591.  This fails because we don't have aRequestingContext (loadInfo->loadingNode) since we didn't set one for \"Save Link As\".\n\n\nOn a separate note, can we consider \"Save Link As\" as TYPE_DOCUMENT?  We consider HTTP downloads from HTTPS pages as mixed content.  So isn't this similar?  Should we be able to do an HTTP \"Save Link As\" on an HTTPS page with a lock?  Will the user assume that the content is fetched over an encrypted connection?",

    "text" : "Hi Tanvi,\nI'm definitely seeing something different than you. I went to the jsfiddle, right-clicked on \"with 302 redirect\" and selected \"save link as\". nsMixedContentBlocker::AsyncOnChannelRedirect doesn't run at all in the child process. It runs in the parent, but it doesn't return early at the nsIParentChannel check. It proceeds into ShouldLoad. I'm not sure what happens inside there since I only have an opt build sitting around and it's hard to debug. It might be that it's denying the request because of the docshell thing you pointed out (but in the parent)?\nhttp://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/security/nsMixedContentBlocker.cpp#591\n\nIn terms of TYPE_DOCUMENT being okay, it doesn't seem unreasonable. In my mind, \"Save link as\" is similar to clicking on the link and then doing \"Save as\" when it's loaded.",

    "text" : "There are multiple issues going on in this bug.\n\nWhen you \"save link as\" without a redirect, we don't go through nsMixedContentBlocker because Content Policies are not getting called.  (Maybe they should be).  When you \"save link as\" with a redirect, AsyncOnChannelRedirect gets called, which triggers Mixed Content Blocker.  Mixed Content Blocker looks for the aRequestingContext (the loadingNode in loadInfo).  If one doesn't exist, it errors out and causes this problem.\n\nWhen you are on an https page and you attempt to download an http resource, Mixed Content Blocker will block that resource, as it should.  If I go to https://mozilla.org and download Firefox, I expect that the download is also HTTPS and can't be switched to malware by a MITM.  Do we want the same behavior for save-link-as?  Using 'save-link-as' in the example in comment 2 results in downloading an mp3.  Shouldn't it get the Mixed Content check the same way downloads do?  And hence TYPE_OTHER is probably the right content type.\n\nI still don't quite understand why we can't pass the doc here - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8561791&action=diff#a/browser/base/content/nsContextMenu.js_sec3\n\nFrom Bill's comment 30, it sounds like the check to see if the process is a child or a parent in nsMixedContentBlocker::AsyncOnChannelRedirect is not robust enough.\n\nSeparately, we should create a bug for better UI / error messaging when Mixed Content Blocker blocks something because of a missing docshell.  Not sure what that messaging should be yet, because a missing docshell isn't exactly a website error.",

Do we care?\n\nSo to sum it up again. For 'save link as ...' we don't perform any content security checks before we start the download. In other words ::ShouldLoad which internally calls mixed content blocker is not called. For redirects however, mixed content blocker implements ::AsyncOnChannelRedirect [1]. In simpler words, for 'save link as...' we do not evaluate mixed content before starting the download but because of the way our implementation works we do evaluate mixed content if that download is redirected. Using the systemPrincipal as the loadingprincipal allows us to bypass mixed content blocking after redirects for 'save link as ...'. This is the behavior we would like to have for now. It has been that way for a long time and we are not making things any worse than they are right now.\n\n[1] https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/security/nsMixedContentBlocker.cpp#210",

All that's needed is the naturalWidth/Height properties, and they can be used to set the dimensions of the canvas the image is drawn to and then toDataURL()ed from (or does Mozilla have a quicker way of converting an image?).

What specifically are you worried about?\nAh, sorry for the lack of context.\n\nSo currently to set the background image the image element itself is passed.  That isn't safe in e10s since the <img/> is in a separate process.\nMy first approach for fixing this was to pass up the image URL to the parent process and create a new image element there and set its src.  However jimm informed me on IRC that this isn't safe, since if the image triggers a vulnerability in the image lib it'll be in the parent process with greater privileges.\nThe new approach, suggested by mconley, is to draw the image to a <canvas/>, then convert that <canvas/> to a data URL, and pass that up to the parent process and create a new <img> with said data URL as its src.  The question is is that safe (since the passed data has been created by Firefox based on a <canvas/>), or is it still susceptible to imglib vulnerabilities?\nIf it's not safe, do you have any other suggestions for safely getting image data based on a web image into the parent process and using it?  Trying to set the background image in the content process doesn't seem like it's viable, since I tink that'll be outside its privileges, and there is also the issue of the preview canvas.",

I went for null because it felt cleaner to have a null value for non-image elements where it doesn't apply (the adjacent cache variables are initialised to null also).

Also when currentURI is null the passed-up value is never going to be used anyway, since currentURI has to exist for any of the desktop background stuff to be in the context menu (due to being contingent on nsContextMenu.onLoadedImage which implies currentURI https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/cd0d976e5f5c/browser/base/content/nsContextMenu.js#l239)",

Once the overflow showed up an attribute changed which caused the ::after element to be removed, and it got stuck in a loop of doing this.  It's possible that something similar is happening here.",

Since I couldn't make the \"...\" ellipsis appear on Linux, I reverted to using the default dropmarker that's inside the toolbarbutton by default (and that I had hidden in the original bug). It looks nice and also perhaps more intuitive (... suggested that there was more to show, but the dropmarker suggests that there's a menu to open).\nIt took a little bit of fiddling with padding in order to center it properly though, and as a result it does look a tiny bit different on Mac and Linux, but not that much, and to be honest, it's not the only thing that looks different in devtools.\n\nAttaching a comparison screenshot.",
