As such, we already have very well tested arguments parsing functions. This patch is more of porting that existing functionality to offline heap snapshots than anything else. In this case, it doesn't make sense to use dictionaries because it would mean duplicating much of that existing code's logic and creating two unshared copies. Additionally, the existing documentation is very thorough and has examples: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/doc/Debugger/Debugger.Memory.md",

The main thread loops 1024*1024*factor times, calling malloc.\n\n3) Compile the test in the same build directory as in step 1 above.\n\n> export JEMALLOC_PATH=`pwd`\n> cc -std=gnu99 -pthread -g3 sampler-test.c -o sampler-test -L$JEMALLOC_PATH/lib -Wl,-rpath,$JEMALLOC_PATH/lib -ljemalloc\n> ./sampler-test 30 # or whatever factor\n\nThe SIGPROF handler dumps some register info, and eventually it crashes.\n\nHere's an example crash:\n\n(gdb) run 30\n<lots of spew>\n...\neax: 0x00000000 ecx: 0x00000064 edx: 0x00000000 eip: 0xb7fa2bd4\n\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n\n(gdb) x $eip\n0xb7fa2bd5 <je_bitmap_sfu+184>: 0xec458bf4\n\n(gdb) x/2i $eip\n=> 0xb7fa2bd5 <je_bitmap_sfu+184>:      hlt\n   0xb7fa2bd6 <je_bitmap_sfu+185>:      mov    -0x14(%ebp),%eax\n\n(gdb) x/3i je_bitmap_sfu+180\n   0xb7fa2bd1 <je_bitmap_sfu+180>:      mov    (%eax),%eax\n   0xb7fa2bd3 <je_bitmap_sfu+182>:      mov    %eax,-0xc(%ebp)\n   0xb7fa2bd6 <je_bitmap_sfu+185>:      mov    -0x14(%ebp),%eax\n\nWTF is going on? The SIGPROF handler reports, on entry, that the saved EIP is 0xb7fa2bd5. Which is bogus, and is in between the valid instructions 0xb7fa2bd3 and 0xb7fa2bd6.",

    "text" : "Canary now ships with a \"Layout editor\" (go to the settings, experimental, then press SHIFT 6 times, then select layout editor).\n\nIt's very similar to the work I've been doing here, except it seems to only work for box-model regions: margin and padding.\nThe way this works right now is quite basic, I believe this is only a first step toward a better tool. As of now, you only get 2 controls, left and right of the selected element, dragging one of them will change the corresponding margin or padding (I don't know how they decide if margin or padding should be changed).\nIf you then drag the other control, the first margin or padding gets back to its original value (which I think is only a bug).\nYou can't change top/bottom for now.\nThe same sort of UX problems we were facing when working on this bug also show up on this new tool.\n\nThis I sort of like: the tool can be used when using the element picker icon. After you select an element, the box-model highlighter remains visible on screen, and you can start resizing the margin. If you then hover over elements in the markup-view, it disappears as it should, so that other elements get highlighted.\n\nThis is somehow counter-intuitive because it goes back to the always-on selection we used to have a couple of years ago with the highlighter, which people got frustrated with, but it's only when you use the element picker, and it's easy to dismiss, so it looks like a good idea to me.\n\nHowever, I think the number of UI controls to change the size, position, border, padding, margin is bound to increase a lot from what they have today, so I wouldn't show these controls by default, maybe bring back the nodeinfobar menu we used to have to allow more things to be done once the highlighter is displayed.",

I figured you might have it more handy... :)\n\nSo I unfortunately can't test this properly right now (I'm working from my Mac without an external monitor today, so I'm working at 300dpi). So, let me know if the new attachment still looks fuzzy.\n\nSo, I believe the blurriness is the result of pixel snapping. There are a few ways to avoid this that I've typed up for Illustrator here >> https://github.com/nt1m/firefox-svg-icons but that doesn't help you a bunch + it's in a weird spot.\n\nFor Sketch,\n\n1. Build your icon at 16x16 with the Pixel Grid turned on. (View > Canvas > Show Pixels.)\n2. Make sure that all x/y coordinates are full pixels for lines/rectangles (Position in the upper right hand corner of Sketch).\n3. Expand all your paths so strokes expand properly as SVG gets resized. (Layer > Paths > Vectorize Stroke)\n4. Align anything that isn't boxy to the pixel grid with item selected then Layer > Round to Nearest Pixel Edge.\n\nThe above docs I've written so far are currently in James + Lin's gitbook docs, but I'll make sure that I add these notes for Sketch in them and update nt1m's repo too. Er, unless the svg is still blurry. Then ~~back to the drawing board~~",

I like it a lot.\n\nSome general comments first:\n- the width x height label that's displayed on the element may unfortunately sometimes hide the drag handle\nFor instance, with an element like this:\n\twidth: 50px;\n\theight: 50px;\n\tbackground: gold;\n\tposition: relative;\n\ttop: 10px;\n\tleft: 100px;\nThe 50px 50px label will hide the left drag handle.\n\n- There are a couple of bugs related to rule-view not updating.\nIf 'top' is defined as an inline style, it only gets updated in the rule-view if the rule-view is the active panel in the sidebar (start the geometry editor, switch to the rule-view, and then drag the element around), but if the layout-view is the active panel, then it doesn't get updated (start the geometry editor, move the element around, then switch to the rule-view).\nAnd if 'top' is defined in a CSS rule instead, then it's never updated when you move the element around.\nHaving new tests checking that the rule-view and computed-view are updated when the layout editor is used would be nice too.\n\n- I like the changes you've made to the test (introducing this helper to simplify the tests), but I wished that was done as a separate commit, that makes it easier to review each one and determine what's code logic changes vs. test changes only.\n\n- I think we should automatically hide the highlighter when we switch to another node. For example: select a positioned element, enable the geometry editor, and then select the <body>.\nI think the editor should just go away in this case because otherwise it's impossible to get out of it (except if you re-select the same positioned element, but in some cases (large DOM tree) it might be hard to find).\n\n::: devtools/client/inspector/test/browser_inspector_highlighter-geometry_01.js\n@@ +2,5 @@\n>   * License, v. 2.0.

I don't think we should really find a way to fix other than making sure the box-model highlighter has a higher z-index than the geometry editor maybe.\n\nAnother way is to enable the geometry editor and then move your mouse over the box-model diagram. I think we should fix this one though because it's really easy to reproduce and leads to the same sort of ugly results. One easy way would be to just not show the box-model highlighter if the geometry editor is enabled.\n\nSomewhat related: if you enable the geometry editor and then click on the element picker icon, then you can't select an element, because mousemove events are not reaching the box-model highlighter (or something).\nI think as soon as the user clicks on that icon to select another element, we should disable the geometry editor (you can listen to the toolbox's \"picker-started\" event).",

Update: after looking at the code, I see there's one defined, but somehow it doesn't show up on hover. I've heard similar problems of HTML tooltips not working in XUL documents before, I think jdescottes knows why, so you should ping him.\n- I've found ways to break the feature a couple of times.

It's especially easy to do when the top/left dimensions are small enough. Then you end up with the labels hiding the handles and you can't grab them anymore.\n- Also, I found another back/forward navigation problem, this time on http://jsbin.com/ . If you load the site, there should be a big head at the top with the jsbin logo and a bunch of links (features, blog, ...) (if you don't have it, click on the jsbin logo to expand the header). Now, inside this header, there's a close button, it's absolutely positioned. Enabling the geometry editor on this element works, but then if you hit back, it disapears and can't be enabled anymore. The problem seems to come from the fact that jsbin pushes history state in js and that might mess with how we destroy/init the highlighter.",

My main concern would be this scenario:\n\n\tchild.addEventListener(\"mouseup\", childMouseUp);\n\tparent.addEventListener(\"mousedown\", () => {\n\t\tparent.addEventListener(\"mouseup\", stopDragging);\n\t\tparent.addEventListener(\"mousemove\", doDrag);\n\t});\n\nIn this case, the drag would 'stick' (stopDragging wouldn't be called in the case of mouseup) if the mouseup happened on the child.  I think if we call this function `addEventListener`, then people will expect that the handler should be called at all relevant times.  We could alternatively change the name of the function to make the difference clear.\n\nIt seems even other event target properties (currentTarget, target) will not be helpful given the scenario.  We could loop up through the parents of the originalTarget and call any handlers if needed...  In that case we might also want to check for calls to preventDefault(), stopPropagation(), etc until we've reimplemented the whole event system :).  Obviously we don't want to go too far with this, but will want to cover what seems like common use-cases for the highlighter API.  \n\nEither way, we should specify both of these cases with *some* behavior in test coverage (even if it's just sticking with the current functionality):\n1) Bind listener on a parent and child, and the event happens that outside of the child\n2) Bind listener on a parent and child, and the event happens on the child",

I don't think we should be making this thing too complex to start with, especially that it's possible that the right answer is to add addEventListener/removeEventListener at AnonymousContent.cpp level instead.\nSo I'd rather keep the behavior as it is right now, it's still sufficient for many use cases to be implemented anyway, and change the function name to reflect this behavior.\nHow does that sound?",

The client-side never really need to know how the Geometry Highlighter's drag/drop is implemented. Right now the client-side doesn't even know if the highlighter has drag/drop support.\nHaving said that, I understand and share your concern about this fake event handling mechanism. It's not great. In fact, I've filed bug 1143649 to implement it properly at webidl/C++ level. Just exposing addEventListener/removeEventListener there is really simple, but it may get really complicated if we want to avoid exposing DOM nodes (via event.target for instance).\n\nSo I think we have at least 2 choices:\n- we can continue with this patch, making sure the add/remove event methods have names and comments that suggest they aren't the real thing, and that a better solution may come in the future (I've changed the name to add/removeNoPropagationEventListener already), knowing that when we implement something better later, compabitility with older servers shouldn't be a problem,\n- or we depend on bug 1143649 instead,\n\nI suggest we at least wait until Ehsan answers the NI? in bug 1143649.\n\n> ::: toolkit/devtools/server/tests/browser/browser_canvasframe_helper_03.js\n> (Diff revision 2)\n> > +  setTimeout(() => {\n> \n> I know you have a ni? out for this, but I'd like to not need a random\n> timeout here.

And I can't seem to find what's taking time here.",

It looks like I can \"wait\" for the layout object to be created by forcing a sync reflow from my test script. So I'll be able to remove the timeout.",

The key idea to fixing this is creating a new RuleEditor similar to how it is done in addNewRule and replace the existing one if the selector is modified successfully. One of the reason I moved it to the Page Actor Style was to access getApplied, and _styleRef, but it seems I can also do that since I have pageStyle in the Style Rule Actor.\n\nCreating a new RuleEditor with the new Rule created by modifySelector if successful means we can edit that new rule as well even if it doesn't match the current selector. See https://cloudup.com/cXXsmO8Ksnn\n\nRather than getting back isModified we would get the arguments required to setup the new Rule for the RuleEditor, and avoid the entire process of refreshing the panel and just swap the RuleEditors with the new one.\n\nIn its current state, we can go with modifying the existing function in the Page Actor Style or Style Rule Actor. Moving it to the Page Actor Style would allow us to refactor some of the shared code between modifySelector and addNewRule, and from a semantic standpoint, I think the functionality should belong in the Page Actor since this is adding new rule that affects the page rather than a Style Rule. The benefit with keeping it in the Style Rule would be backward compatibility.\n\nDo you have any preferences with which direction we should go? I am already swinging towards keeping the function in the Style Rule Actor for backward compatibility.\n\nThere are a couple of concerns that will need to be addressed which is if rule overridden is appearing correctly, and how to handle invalid selectors when we are performing stylesheet.insertRule since the try catch doesn't seem to be doing its job as described in comment #5.",

But my general advice here is at least for the initial review, favor keeping it in the current actor for backwards compat over semantics *if* doing so doesn't cause extra backwards compat headache for if/when we move it elsewhere.  Then if you two decide the benefit of refactoring / better semantics is worth it, manage that in a second patch that's just focused on doing that.",

See https://cloudup.com/cXXsmO8Ksnn\nAh, yes, good point. But I guess my proposals allowed for this too. With my solution, you'd just keep the same rule editor, somehow greyd out, but it should still work, right? I haven't tried this.\n\n> The key idea to fixing this is creating a new RuleEditor similar to how it\n> is done in addNewRule and replace the existing one if the selector is\n> modified successfully.\nI guess I'm ok with this approach, but I'd like to see some code refactored here. In your patch, the code in _onSelectorDone looks almost exactly like the one in _onAddRule. So we need a new function to handle this.\nRefreshing the whole panel as we used to do before this patch sounds bad because we know the performance of the rule-view isn't great, but if it were, I'd much more inclined for a solution like this rather than spreading out the complex new Rule + new RuleEditor logic throughout rule-view.js\nSo, at least refactor this part so it's all done in one place.\n\n> In its current state, we can go with modifying the existing function in the\n> Page Actor Style or Style Rule Actor.

The layout-change issue isn't great, for sure, but the way the rule-view UI workflow is implemented right now is so confusing that I'd prefer having a dedicated bug to add yet one more way to refresh/populate the view.\n\nYou're approach in this patch is pretty simple, but as you said, we need to preserve the sorting of rules, and I'd like to keep some time to think of other potential ways to implement this.\nRight now if you trigger a layout-change and the selected node has inherited rules, then the unmatched rules will appear below that, which feels odd somehow.\nI wish we didn't even have to refresh the view fully on layout changes, but we do need to handle media-queries and markup changes on resize anyway.\n\nI wish we had a client-side model of the rules to which we could write from the rule-view, and when a server-side update would be needed, we would update the model accordingly and only then refresh the view.\nElementStyle is the closest thing to this, but it's not clear how the model is built/updated.\nSo I'd like the new bug to be about making ElementStyle more like a model:\n- all rules (even unmatched) should be stored in this.rules\n- there should be a add method,\n- there should be a clear method (unless we do a new ElementStyle everytime, I don't remember),\n- populate should not replace this.rules entirely but only update/insert",

We could just not have the traits object at all, and just the property on _form, but introducing this extra object level now may prove useful in the future)\n- remove the change in root.js\n- remove the this.traits definition you added here in initialize\n- just use this.supportsModifySelectorUnmatched in the protocol modifySelector custom method in the front\n- in rule-view.js, instead of using \n  this.target.client.traits.modifySelectorUnmatched;\n  use this.rule.domRule.supportsModifySelectorUnmatched.\n\nI think this should work, and helps keep the handling of the backward compatibility contained to the files that actually have to deal with it.",

So the first && expression in this conditional says, \"we can now show a suggested tile,\" and the second && expression says, \"we should now hide the suggested tile,\" is that basically right?  If so, I still don't completely understand the first && expression, because if the most frecent link does not have a targeted site, then no suggested tile can be shown even though there are >= 8 history tiles, right?\n\nActually, it does seem that this method is being used in two different ways.  The onLinkChanged caller seems to be using it as, \"did the suggested tile change visibility?\"  But the _updateSuggestedTile caller seems to be using it as, \"should the suggested tile be visible?\"",

So the logic says if we have enough history links (8+) to show a suggested tile and we are not already showing a suggested tile, then we should update (to *attempt* to add a suggested tile). OR if we don't have enough history to show a suggested tile (<8) and we are currently showing one, we should update (to remove it) \n\nSo I guess it's checking for both suggested tile visibility and number of history tiles.\n\n> So the first && expression\n> in this conditional says, \"we can now show a suggested tile,\" and the second\n> && expression says, \"we should now hide the suggested tile,\" is that\n> basically right?  \n\nyes\n\n> If so, I still don't completely understand the first &&\n> expression, because if the most frecent link does not have a targeted site,\n> then no suggested tile can be shown even though there are >= 8 history\n> tiles, right?\n\nIf the most frecent link does not have a targeted site, that means it is not a suggested link. But I don't see why this would mean no suggested tile can be shown?",

We can backout and keep this bug open to track relanding once a proper fix is ready. If this is expected to take more than a few days to fix, I think it's preferable to backout of m-c as well.",

I suggested setting compatibility to â‰¤ Firefox 28.0 based on that information.\nI'd tested these two add-ons in Firefox 36.0 and Nightly 39 in Windows 7. I later also tested in Linux Mint.

When markup-view is destroyed, it tells the server to hide the highlighter but if the server has already destroyed the highlighter actor the request fails. As markup-view intentionally ignores any response coming from the server [1], the rejection is left uncaught.\n\nSince head.js already contains the code [2] that tears the tools down gracefully, the test(s) might as well use it.\n\nTry: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=f033d4ee9c06\n\n[1] https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/markupview/markup-view.js#1444\n[2] https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/markupview/test/head.js#43",

When I get around to looking at Nightly by hovering over the taskbar preview I see a message that Nightly did not load the extension \"from this site\". No site is shown and when I click on the preview pane to give Nightly focus, the message went away.\t \nWhat happened? (actual results)\nThe extension didn't load, I briefly encountered a barely helpful message that said it didn't load and decided I wanted to dismiss it for no particular reason.\nWhat should have happened? (expected results)\nInstructions that stick around should help the user know what to do if in fact he wants to load the extension and perhaps more information should be given to help him decide if he wants to change his mind.",

I think it is important that we create the sense that Firefox is doing the suggesting - not an unknowable 3rd party, so, +1 to \"by Firefox\"\n\n2. I think we need to give more context for why it is suggested - adding \"based on inference of your interests\" ?\n\n3. I do not think that we need to use the term \"Tile\" here.  \"Tile\" is an internal / partner facing term, and I understand that it does not work very well in localisation - (i.e. ceramic oblongs used to decorate walls have not given rise to other metaphorical uses).  Why not call it an \"advert\", or \"notice\", or \"content\" ?\n\n4. Why change the label in the UI?  \"Sponsored\" - what difference does it make to the user?  I would suggest that we use \"Sponsored\" for both Directory and Suggested (nee Related) Tiles, or \"Sponsored - Suggested\" (that may be too long).  \"Suggested\" is rather more confusing to me.  I need to know it is sponsored, and then I may wish to know why it is suggested.\n\nSo, my suggestion is:\n\n[Sponsored] or [Sponsored - Suggested] as the tag and then \n\n\"This content is suggested to you by Firefox based on inference of your interests.\"",

This is similar to what some of the guys here have concepted around the 4th column reserved for paid/suggested tiles. With our current tile dimensions and considering the user's screen resolutions, the real estate to show a dedicated bottom row or 4th column could be an issue. I think we can learn a lot from the introduction with one suggested tile and take it from there. Yes, let's discuss when you're in NYC.",

I think this is probably because the popups would be too crowded/noisy with a 3rd button added, and it likely wouldn't be used as much.\n\n(In reply to Francesco Lodolo [:flod] from comment #18)\n> \"Sync\" (two title strings): I assume this is a generic string, not the\n> feature name?\n> \n> If that's the case, \"Sign in to access your Reading List everywhere you use\n> %S.\" is pretty confusing. Sign in to what?\n\n\"sync\" is messy, because it's both a commonly used word to describe the feature and is also the branded product name (which we use syncBrandShortName for). For the title, \"Sync\" is used to describe the feature. But for the body, it's referring to Sync as a product.\n\nIt may make sense for some locales to re-order \"Sign in to access your Reading List everywhere you use Sync.\" so that Sync (the product) is directly tied to \"sign in\".\n\nDo you think an additional localization note should be added for this?",

It calls an actor request in a setInterval loop, but nothing guarantees that responses are going to follow the same cadence, so if responses take time to come back, we may start to accumulate a bunch of responses that haven't yet been received. The stopAutoRefresh used in the test only clears the interval, without waiting for all responses to be back.\nMy fix will be to make this function async and wait for the buffer to clear out.",

The test sends the fifth auto-refresh update request\n2. Time goes on, server is slow (hits a GC or something) and the auto-refresh interval is over.\n3. The test sends an extra auto-refresh update request\n4. The fifth refresh finishes, the test stops the auto-refresh and closes the connection.\n\nAt this point the extra request is still pending which causes the rejection here.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by making the front store the Promise for the last request sent to the server and blocks the test on it. This works as protocol.js guarantees that replies to pending requests come in the order they were sent.",

When Firefox updates, it will have to be restarted to apply the update.

Instead we should either/both:\n\nA. Download the new GMP before the update happens and use it immediately on update\nB.

The reason this code sets the mstone prefs as well is to avoid the \"what's new\" page popping up, because the new profile won't have any mstone pref set at all (without this code), and it's odd to get a \"hey, you just updated, here's what's new in this version of Firefox\" page when all you've done is resetting your profile.\n\nI don't think that file needs touching for this patch.\n\nThe upgrade path sets the mstone things here:\n\nhttp://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/nsBrowserContentHandler.js?mark=120-136#92\n\nAFAICT.",

Parts 2-5 were folded together to become \"Part 2\". Part 6 remained separate as \"Part 3\". Sorry for the confusion. The 6 separate parts were to make reviews easier, but they weren't as useful in pieces so it didn't make sense for bi-section purposes to land them separately.\n\nWe don't need to uplift the Part 6 (what landed as \"part 3\") because it is a test-only fix that doesn't affect the outcome of the test.",

In this particular \"special\" case, JitRuntime::Mark seems to be a complete misnomer: the actual function appears to directly iterate the heap cells (red flag 1) of the atoms zone (red flag 2) and trace all JitCode (red flag 3). What in the world is JitCode doing in the atoms zone? No idea! I'd *guess* someone dumped it there when they didn't have a zone handy and we happen to not mark it because it's held live elsewhere but needs to be traced because.... This code is almost certainly either wrong or so poorly designed that it's equivalent to wrong.\n\n> Second, I still think this needs read barriers as we discussed on Vidyo.
